 * drift from the format the actual files use.
 *
 * This is the only test in the repo that calls a filesystem WRITER in-process,
 * and its default root is the working tree. That combination bites: if root
 * handling ever breaks — a bug, or a mutant during mutation testing — the write
 * escapes into the real repo, and the assertion that catches it fires only
 * AFTER the damage. So the three real files are snapshotted up front and put
 * back on the way out, making an escape self-healing rather than something the
 * next `git diff` has to discover.
 *
 * The restore is conditional: rewriting identical bytes on every run would
 * churn the mtime of three tracked files and invalidate build caches for a test
 * that is supposed to be read-only outside its scratch directory.
