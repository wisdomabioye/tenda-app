/**
 * Example P2P exchange corridors surfaced by the TradeDeck — each row is one
 * "crypto → local cash" movement: the asset side (what's locked in escrow, on
 * which chain) and the fiat side (what the counterparty receives, over which
 * payout rail).
 *
 * THREE RULES, each learned the hard way:
 *
 *   1. Only currencies an offer can actually be denominated in may appear —
 *      the payout registry's. These rows read as product screenshots, so a row
 *      in a currency outside the registry is a promise the Exchange will refuse
 *      the moment someone tries it. The registry is the authority and
 *      `markets.test.ts` enforces it; this rule names no currencies, because
 *      the version that did said "i.e. NGN, KES and GHS" and called a ZAR or
 *      PHP row a broken promise — which became the exact opposite of the truth
 *      when South Africa, the Philippines and the UAE shipped.
 *   2. Rails stay GENERIC — "Bank transfer", "Mobile money". Tenda integrates
 *      no payment provider: it stores the account details a user types in and
 *      the two parties settle between themselves. Naming M-Pesa, OPay, GCash,
 *      Wise or SEPA implies an integration that does not exist, and only some
 *      markets declare a mobile-money rail at all — read the specs, do not
 *      assume.
 *   3. FIAT AMOUNTS ARE ROUNDED, to at most two significant figures, and the
 *      card prefixes them with "≈". These rows divide out to an exchange rate
 *      — 120 USDC for 187,200 NGN was publishing 1,560 NGN/USDC — and a
 *      precise-looking number on a marketplace page reads as the rate you will
 *      get. It is not: the seller prices their own offer, Tenda takes no
 *      spread, and this file has no live source, so the implied rate ages with
 *      the naira and nothing here notices. Rounding removes the false
 *      precision; `markets.test.ts` keeps it removed.
 *
 *      THE RATE LEVEL WAS DELIBERATELY NOT CHANGED. Rounding is not a refresh:
 *      the implied rates still sit roughly where they were, because nothing in
 *      this repo can verify today's true rate. Treat the levels as marketing
 *      copy that someone owns refreshing, and the roundness as the guard that
 *      stops them being read as a quote in the meantime.
 *
 * EDIT THIS FILE to add or change showcased corridors, within those rules.
