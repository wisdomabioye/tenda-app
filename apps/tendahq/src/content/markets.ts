/**
 * Fiat markets — DERIVED from the shared payout registry, the same specs the
 * server validates against, so the landing can never advertise a corridor the
 * product will refuse.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP:
 *
 *   - `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES` is a DISPLAY preference — what you can see your
 *     balance quoted in. It is not a trading capability.
 *   - `PAYOUT_CURRENCIES` is what an offer can actually be denominated in.
 *     `routes/v1/exchange` requires a sell offer's `fiat_currency` to equal
 *     `payoutCurrencyForCountry(account.country)`, so the payout registry's
 *     countries are the whole set.
 *
 * The landing conflated the two and advertised "8 corridors". Deriving both
 * numbers from their real sources is what stops that recurring the next time
 * a currency is added for display only.
 *
 * NEITHER COUNT IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE, on purpose. An earlier version of this
 * docstring said "(8)" and "(3)". Both were true when typed and both went
 * stale — display gained AED, and payout gained South Africa, the Philippines
 * and the UAE — leaving the file that exists to prevent stale numbers stating
 * two of them. The values below derive; prose about them should not compete.
