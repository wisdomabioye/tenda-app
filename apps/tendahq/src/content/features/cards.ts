/**
 * The 0G agent rail — Onboarding's 0G card. Not a gas policy (0G's manifest
 * policy is 'none', which deliberately contributes no card), so like
 * WALLET_FEATURE it is hand-written; unlike it, it NAMES A CHAIN, which is why
 * its status derives rather than being declared.
 *
 * IT SHIPPED. This card read `roadmap` with the copy "an agent WILL fund
 * escrow" and a fact line of "on the roadmap" — written while the x402
 * sign-only design was decided but unbuilt, and left behind when it was built.
 * The fund route, the agent API and a full agent-to-human hire settling in four
 * on-chain transactions all landed and were verified end to end on 0G Galileo.
 * A stale roadmap label understates shipped work exactly as a premature live
 * one overstates unshipped work; both are the same failure to keep a status
 * tied to something real.
 *
 * It reads Testnet rather than Live because the rail relays an on-chain
 * transaction into the escrow contract, so it genuinely depends on that contract
 * being deployed — and it names 0G MAINNET, which is launching, not live. It
 * becomes Live on its own the day #13 deploys, with no edit here. That chain
 * dependency is what separates it from WALLET_FEATURE, whose transports do not
 * touch the escrow at all.

 * primary reader and had nothing addressed to them: 0G declares
 * `gasPolicy: 'none'`, so it contributes no gas card, and the launch chain was
 * absent from the getting-started section entirely.
 *
 * Every clause is a shipped fact, not positioning. An agent posts and funds
 * through the same escrow primitive a person uses (#19 composes
 * draftResolution / attachGigDetails / relayDraftFunding); the badge is real and
 * on every surface that names a counterparty (PersonCard, GigCard, the gig
 * poster card, the profile page, with its own e2e spec); and the lifecycle that
 * follows is the ordinary one, settled end to end in #20.
 *
 * TYPOGRAPHIC quotes, not straight ones. React escapes `"` to `&quot;` in text,
 * so a body containing straight quotes does not survive into the markup as
 * written — and the onboarding render test compares the raw string against the
 * rendered HTML. It passed only while this card was not the default rail; the
 * moment it led the section the mismatch surfaced. Curly quotes pass through
 * untouched, and match the sibling notes.
 *
 * The badge text is READ FROM the shared constant rather than typed. If the app
 * ever relabels agents, copy promising a specific label would quietly become a
 * promise the product no longer keeps.
