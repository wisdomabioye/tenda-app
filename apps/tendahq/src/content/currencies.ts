/**
 * Display currencies — DERIVED from @tenda/shared's CURRENCY_META, the same
 * vocabulary the server prices against and every client renders from.
 *
 * THIS FILE REPLACES A HAND-KEPT COPY, and the copy had already drifted: it
 * listed eight currencies against shared's nine, silently omitting AED. That
 * copy fed `DISPLAY_CURRENCY_COUNT`, so the landing rendered "8" for a product
 * that supports 9 — the exact class of false claim `markets.ts` was written to
 * prevent, reintroduced one import away from it.
 *
 * The copy justified itself with "kept inline so the marketing site has no
 * workspace-package dependency". That was not true when it was written: the
 * site imports @tenda/shared in ten places, including `markets.ts`, which
 * reads the payout registry from shared and the currencies from the copy in
 * the same file.
 *
 * Only the PROJECTION lives here — shared keys its metadata by code and this
 * site's components want the code on the object. Nothing about which
 * currencies exist, or what they are called, is decided in this file.
