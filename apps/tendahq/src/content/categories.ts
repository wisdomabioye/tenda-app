/**
 * Gig categories — DERIVED from @tenda/shared's category registry, the same
 * one mobile and web render from.
 *
 * THIS FILE REPLACES A HAND-KEPT COPY THAT CONTRADICTED TWO PRODUCT
 * DECISIONS, both recorded in shared's own docstrings:
 *
 *   - It labelled `photo` "Photo". Shared labels it "Creative", and says why:
 *     mobile once shipped both spellings for the same category and the
 *     consolidation existed to end that. The landing had quietly reopened it.
 *   - It carried icons `Truck` / `Footprints` / `Code`. Shared carries
 *     `Bike` / `ShoppingBag` / `Laptop` from the 2026-08-15 decision that the
 *     product is micro-tasks — "'Bike' not 'Truck', 'Laptop' not 'Monitor'".
 *     The landing was rendering the icons that decision rejected.
 *
 * Neither was reachable by a test, because a copy agrees with itself.
 *
 * EMOJI IS THE ONE LOCAL EXTRA, and it is a landing-only display choice — the
 * chips here are emoji where the apps use lucide glyphs. It follows the
 * convention `chains.ts` already sets: marketing extras keyed by the shared
 * vocabulary, nothing else decided locally. The Record is TOTAL over
 * `GigCategory`, so a category added to shared fails this file's compile
 * instead of rendering a chip with a hole in it.
