/**
 * The hire loop, as data — for a human poster and for an AI agent.
 *
 * ONE CIRCUIT, TWO ENTRANCES. Both lanes are six steps with four on-chain
 * transactions, and steps 3-6 are the same machine. Only the way in differs,
 * and that difference is the section's whole argument:
 *
 *   human — the poster's own wallet signs AND BROADCASTS, and pays for it
 *           (apps/web/stores/escrow.store.ts: `request<Action>() → unsigned tx
 *           → wallet signs + broadcasts`; there is no relayer in that path).
 *   agent — the agent signs an x402 payment authorization and broadcasts
 *           nothing; Tenda's relayer pays that gas
 *           (apps/server/src/scripts/agent-hire-e2e, #20, settled end to end).
 *
 * TRANSCRIBED, NOT WRITTEN. Every payer below is the one the code produces,
 * including the two that surprise people: the relayer covers an agent's
 * funding transaction, and a poster who ASSIGNS an applicant pays for that
 * worker's accept — `POST /v1/escrows/:id/assign` is "the transition where the
 * WORKER signs nothing".
 *
 * NO CHAIN IS NAMED here on purpose. The rail is a property of the API, not of
 * a deployment, so naming one would make this copy answerable to
 * `chain-status.ts` for no gain — see the whole-page deployment-claim guard.
