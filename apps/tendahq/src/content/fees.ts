/**
 * Fee and deadline facts — DERIVED from the shared platform-config defaults,
 * the same constants the `platform_config` columns default to and the server
 * falls back to when the row is unseeded.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. "2.5%" was written out as a literal in six places
 * across the landing — the fee FAQ twice, the minimum-amount answer, §04's
 * worked example, the Seeker proof point and the hero's loading state — while
 * the hero ALSO rendered the live figure from `/v1/platform/config`. Every one
 * of those numbers is admin-editable at runtime, so the page could show a live
 * 2% in the hero and a hardcoded 2.5% in the FAQ on the same screen.
 *
 * Two rules follow from that:
 *
 *   1. Nothing on the landing types a fee or window figure. It comes from here,
 *      or — where the surface can run a hook — live from the platform config
 *      via `<FeePct />`.
 *   2. These values are the DEFAULTS, not the truth. The live config wins
 *      wherever it can be read; this is what to print while it loads, and the
 *      floor under any copy that cannot run a hook (a plain string in a data
 *      table). They can never drift from the server, because they are the
 *      server's own constants.
