            In the escrow program on Solana —{' '}
            <strong>not in a Tenda bank account, not in the worker&apos;s wallet.</strong>{' '}
            When you fund a gig, SOL moves directly from your wallet into a program-derived
            account that only the contract can release. Tenda has no admin key, no pause button,
            no sweep function.

          <p>
            You can read the source and inspect any settlement on Solana Explorer. Program ID is
            published in the trust strip at the top of this page.

      answer: (

          <p>
            Two things. <strong>First:</strong> nothing is paid until proof clears. If the worker
            walks away, the funds simply return to the poster after the proof-submission deadline
            passes — the poster claims the refund on-chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Second:</strong> every worker accumulates a public history. The on-chain
            user account tracks <code className="font-mono">completed_gigs</code> directly;
            ratings, reviews, and dispute counts are kept off-chain by Tenda and shown beside
            every profile. A fresh worker can still be hired, but most posters favour history —
            the market self-cleans over time.
          </p>

      ),

    {
      id: 'Q.03',
      question: 'What stops a poster from refusing to release after the work is done?',
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            Two safeguards. <strong>Auto-approve:</strong> if the poster doesn&apos;t approve or
            dispute within the review window (planned: 48 hours after proof submission), the
            program auto-releases SOL to the worker.{' '}
            <em>(See &quot;Planned&quot; on §04 fallback route B.)</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dispute:</strong> if the poster contests the work, either side opens a dispute
            after proof is submitted. Tenda mediation reviews evidence and instructs the program
            to release or refund — you don&apos;t need to take the poster&apos;s word for it.

    },
    {
      id: 'Q.04',
      question: 'Has the contract been audited?',
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            <strong>Not yet.</strong> Tenda is currently on Solana devnet ({APP_INFO.version}). A
            third-party audit will land before public mainnet launch — once the report is
            published the firm and date will appear in the §04 chain-meta strip and here.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, the source is open. Anyone with Rust + Anchor familiarity can read
            the program and the test suite end-to-end before depositing.

      id: 'Q.05',
      question: 'What happens if Tenda (the company) goes away?',
      answer: (
        <>
          <p>
            The escrow program lives on Solana — independent of any Tenda server. Existing
            escrows continue to settle on the same logic: proof → release, deadline → refund,
            dispute → mediation. The mobile app is open-source; anyone can fork and rehost the
            UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            The piece that depends on Tenda the company is dispute mediation. If the company
            disappeared, open disputes would either auto-release on the review-window timer or
            need a successor mediator. We&apos;ll publish a successor plan before mainnet.
