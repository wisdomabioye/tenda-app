/**
 * The FAQ answers are JSX values sitting in a data table, so nothing else in
 * this suite ever renders them — a claim can be edited back in and every other
 * test stays green. This renders every answer and asserts on the TEXT that
 * reaches the DOM.
 *
 * The absent-list is not a style guide. Each entry is a specific claim that was
 * on this page and was false against the contracts or the server:
 *
 *   - the platform fee was said to be borne by posters, with "workers and
 *     buyers pay 0%", while `_settleToCounterparty` pays the worker
 *     `amount − fee`;
 *   - "Tenda has no admin key" — both programs have an `onlyAdmin`;
 *   - `completed_gigs` was described as on-chain; it exists nowhere;
 *   - M-Pesa / OPay / GCash were named as rails; no payment provider is
 *     integrated at all, and only Ghana has a mobile-money spec;
 *   - "8 corridors" counted the display-currency list;
 *   - disputes were said to "release SOL", wrong on every chain;
 *   - the dispute bond was promised back to a good-faith raiser; the contract
 *     pays it to the WINNER;
 *   - Google/Apple sign-in was offered while neither provider is configured.
 *
 * A hit here means the page has started lying again in a way that already cost
 * one audit to find.
