            One escrow contract, built for {APP_INFO.chains.networksLine} —{' '}
            {MAINNET_STATUS_CLAUSE}. Each brings something different:{' '}

            Gig work is global by default — the contracts run wherever the chains do, and a gig
            escrowed in USDC needs nothing from your local banking system.

          <p>
            Cashing out to local money is narrower, and worth being exact about. Exchange offers
            can be denominated in{' '}
            <code className="font-mono">{TRADE_CURRENCIES_PROSE}</code> — {TRADE_MARKET_COUNT}{' '}
            markets: {TRADE_COUNTRIES_PROSE}. Separately, you can view your balance in any of{' '}
            {DISPLAY_CURRENCY_COUNT} currencies (
            <code className="font-mono">{SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES.join(' · ')}</code>), which is a
            display setting rather than a market you can trade into. New markets open as we clear
            each one and as buyers and sellers show up there.
