 * than each component choosing one (#55) — see `sections/landing-sections.ts`.
 *
 * Note this type cannot enforce that a section HONOURS the prop: a component
 * that declares no props at all is still assignable to `ComponentType` of this,
 * so one that quietly hardcodes its surface type-checks. That gap is what
 * `landing-sections.test.tsx` exists to close, by rendering each section at
 * both surfaces and reading the markup back.
