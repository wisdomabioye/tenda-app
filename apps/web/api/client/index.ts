/**
 * The typed API client, composed from one module per domain.
 *
 * It was a single 355-line file, already over the size budget before approval
 * mode added six endpoints to it. Splitting by domain keeps each module the
 * size of the surface it describes, and the barrel means every existing
 * `from '@/api/client'` import kept working unchanged.
 *
 * The HTTP core (base URL, bearer, timeout, error envelope) stays in
 * ../request — these modules only describe endpoints.
