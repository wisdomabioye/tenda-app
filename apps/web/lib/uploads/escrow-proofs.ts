 * had nothing to hash on retry unless they uploaded the same files again.
 *
 * Read back from the server rather than composed from the client's copy of the
 * detail, so the seal describes what is actually stored at the moment of
 * signing and not what this tab last happened to fetch.
 *
 * SORTED, because a set has no inherent order and the digest must not depend
 * on the order rows come back in — `GET /escrows/:id/proofs` declares none.
 * `proofHashFor` stays order-SENSITIVE (it is a hash over a list); this is the
