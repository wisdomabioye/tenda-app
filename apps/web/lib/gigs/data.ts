 *
 * Caching decision (stage-1 doc asks for it to be stated): none. Every request
 * re-fetches — gig state moves and a takedown must 404 immediately, never be
 * served from a stale page. Revisit with `use cache` + a short cacheLife only

 *
 * Null, not an exception, because the alternative is the route error boundary
 * — and that is a CLIENT component, so with JavaScript off a failed read
 * rendered a blank page (see FeedErrorStatic). Answering the same `null` to
 * both callers lets the page render an honest state server-side and lets
 * `generateMetadata` mark that render `noindex`, which a 200 carrying an error
 * message otherwise would not be.
 *
 * `cache()` keys on argument identity, and the two callers each build their own
 * query object — so the KEY is the serialised query and the object is rebuilt
 * inside. `toGigListQuery` writes its fields in a fixed literal order, which is
 * what makes the serialisation stable; it is the single producer of this shape.
 *
 * The dedupe is a NEXT-RUNTIME property — React `cache()` needs a request
 * scope, which the unit harness does not provide, so it is not asserted there.
 * Measured against a running production build instead: one `/gigs` render, one
 * `/v1/gigs` hit, with `generateMetadata` and the page both calling this.
