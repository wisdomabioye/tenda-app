/**
 * Everything of WEB's that must not outlive an account.
 *
 * The registry itself is not here. `accountGeneration`, `isSameAccount`,
 * `beginAccountSession`, `registerAccountReset` and `clearAccountState` come
 * from `@tenda/shared`, where mobile reads them too (#65) and where web ran a
 * byte-equivalent private copy of them until #74. They are re-exported below, so
 * no import site in this app had to move. What is left here is the part that is
 * genuinely web's: the module-scoped list CACHES, and the fact that each one is
 * registered.
 *
 * The package ROOT is the only way in — there is no `@tenda/shared/account`
 * subpath in the exports map — which is what makes it ONE registry and ONE
 * counter rather than the two #74 removed. The suite beside this file asserts
 * that rather than assuming it.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing live longer than the components that fill them:
 *
 *   - module-scoped list CACHES, because the workspace's list columns are
 *     remounted by the router on every row they open, so page zero has to
 *     outlive the component or the column blinks; and
 *   - zustand STORES, which are module singletons by construction.
 *
 * Module scope also outlives the SESSION. Signing out is a soft navigation —
 * `router.replace('/gigs')` keeps the JS context and every module in it — so
 * without this the next account in the same tab inherits the last one's state.
 * Measured before any of it existed: a second sign-in showed the first
 * account's dispute subjects, and (#25) the first account's gig detail,
 * counterparty and proofs included.
 *
 * REGISTER IN THE MODULE THAT OWNS THE STATE — a cache here, a store in its own
 * file. The alternative — a list of reset calls inside `logout` — is what this
 * arrangement exists to fix: three stores were added over three tasks and none
 * of them was ever added to that list, because the place you must not forget was
 * nowhere near the state you were writing.
 * `stores/__tests__/account-scope.guard.test.ts` fails on a new store that is
 * neither registered nor listed as account-agnostic, and the suite beside this
 * file fails on a cache exported here that the registry cannot reach — so
 * forgetting either kind is a red test rather than a leak.
 *
 * Account-AGNOSTIC state deliberately stays out: the chain registry and the
 * platform config are public server facts, identical for every reader, and
 * clearing them would refetch on the next sign-in for nothing — worse, it
 * would blank a rendered balance while the registry reloaded.
