/**
 * Where sign-in should put the reader back.
 *
 * `AuthGate` sends an anonymous visitor to /signin from wherever they were
 * heading, and before this the destination was simply lost — a deep link into
 * any (app) route landed on /home once they had signed in. #17 made that
 * sharper: /my-gigs/<escrowId> is the authed escrow view, so a link shared out
 * of the app stranded a recipient who already had an account.
 *
 * It rides in a SEARCH PARAM rather than the sign-in flow store, deliberately.
 * That store is in-memory on purpose (it holds the address someone typed, and
 * web must not put that in the URL), and a deep link is exactly the case where
 * the tab was opened fresh — there is no memory to survive.
 *
 * EVERY value here is attacker-supplied. A `?next=` that is not validated is
 * an open redirect: a link to our own sign-in page that lands the reader on
 * somebody else's, with our domain in the part of the URL they read. So this
 * module is a whitelist, not a blacklist — anything that is not recognisably
 * one of our own paths is refused and the caller falls back to /home.
