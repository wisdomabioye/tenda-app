/**
 * `?next=` is attacker-supplied, and an unvalidated one is an open redirect:

 * our domain in the part of the URL a person actually reads.

 * So the refusals lead here, and each is written as its own case rather than a
 * loop over a list — a loop reports "the table failed" and these fail for
 * different reasons, each of which is a different way past a naive check.
