/**
 * Web port of apps/mobile/hooks/useNotificationsRealtime.ts, verbatim:
 * keeps the bell badge current app-wide. Live personal notices arrive over
 * the already-subscribed `user:<id>` WS channel (realtime.store routes them
 * into the store); this hook covers what WS can't: the initial count on
 * mount, and a resync after a reconnect (which also catches broadcast
 * announcements, since those aren't WS-pushed). Mounted once in AppShell,
 * beside useInboxRealtime.
