/**
 * Web port of apps/mobile/hooks/useMyGigs.ts: the caller's Posted,
 * Working, Drafts and Applications lists, each independently paginated.
 *
 * The chain filter arrives as an ARGUMENT rather than living here, because the
 * list is a workspace column now and the router remounts it on every row it
 * opens — local state would snap back to "all chains" each time. It rides the
 * URL, where a remount can still read it.
 *
 * Drafts are their OWN list (never rows mixed into Posted): "Posted" is
 * POSTED_ESCROW_STATUSES exactly, so its count chip can never be inflated
 * by pre-signature staging rows. Drafts feed a banner above Posted that
 * links to /my-gigs/drafts. ALL lists load on mount so inactive tabs'
 * count chips read a real server `total`, never a zero for an unfetched
 * list. Mobile's focus refresh has no web analogue (pages remount on
 * navigation). Applications are deliberately NOT chain-filtered:
 * /v1/applications is caller-scoped with no chain parameter.
