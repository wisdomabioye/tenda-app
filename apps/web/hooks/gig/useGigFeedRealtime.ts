'use client'

/**
 * The gig feed's live wiring, for every surface that shows one.
 *
 * Both web surfaces that show one read the same `feed:gigs` broadcast (mobile
 * has its own hook over the same shared reducer) and must agree on what a
 * frame MEANS — which gig is newer, which one the reader's filters still
 * include, when the client may decide and when only the server can. That
 * agreement is `applyGigFeedEvent` in `@tenda/shared`; this hook is the
 * agreement about everything around it: seeding from the rendered page,
 * trimming to the page size, keeping a total honest, recording a revision even
 * when the frame is declined, and catching up when the socket is down.
 *
 * What legitimately differs is left to the caller, as two callbacks:
 *   - `project` — what this surface STORES. The anonymous feed keeps base
 *     units out of the payload it ships to the browser and holds a card model;
 *     the signed-in list renders the amount and holds the whole summary.
 *   - `onReconcile` — how this surface asks the server for the truth. The
 *     anonymous feed is server-rendered, so it refreshes the RSC tree; a
 *     client-fetched list refetches itself.
 *
 * It does NOT open the socket. A surface inside the workspace already has one
 * from the layout; the public page opens its own. Mounting a second lifecycle
 * here would fight whichever owns it.
