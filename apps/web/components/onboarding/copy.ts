/**
 * The pre-account surfaces' strings: the welcome hero and the three-slide
 * value-prop carousel (Auth comp, lines 409-452).
 *
 * The comp's wording is used because these screens have no shared counterpart:
 * mobile's welcome says "Work. Earn. Instantly." over four slides written for
 * a phone-first flow with a "no crypto experience needed" beat that the web
 * app does not make. Two flows, two audiences, and no cross-client vocabulary
 * to fork — the same reasoning as `AUTH_COPY`.
