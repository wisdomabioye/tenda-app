/**
 * Who is paying (comp lines 639-655).
 *
 * Reputation is public by design — the reviews a person has collected are
 * part of what makes an escrow worth taking — but a name and an average is
 * all this page shows. The note under the card says where the rest lives
 * rather than teasing a locked panel.
 *
 * `review_score` is a numeric(3,2) STRING on the wire and NULLABLE: null is
 * "nobody has reviewed them", which is a different statement from a low score
 * and is worded as one. The comp also carries a `creatorMeta` line (gigs
 * posted, member since); nothing on this wire supplies it, and inventing a
 * plausible sentence under someone's name is the one thing this card must not
 * do. Spec-correction #13.
