 * Advisory early warning that no linked wallet can cover the budget, shown
 * while the form is still being filled — web twin of mobile's
 * gig-form/AddFundsNudge. Funding happens at publish, where
 * `ensureSufficientBalance` is the actual stop. Reads through the SAME
 * `readSpendableBalance` as that check, so the hint and the block always
 * agree. Silent unless the balance is KNOWN and short: an unread balance is
 * unknown, not zero, so an RPC failure never accuses the user of being
 * underfunded.
