/**
 * The Post Wizard's five steps (comp: "Tenda Post Wizard").
 *
 * This is a REGROUPING of the fields mobile's three-step composer already
 * collects — not a second definition of what a valid gig is. Every step's
 * requirement is composed from the shared per-field checks, so a threshold
 * can never drift between the two clients.
 *
 * Three rules the comp proposes are deliberately NOT adopted:
 *   • title of at least 12 characters
 *   • description of at least 30
 *   • at least one proof type
 * Shared's gig-composer contract states that what a valid gig is cannot fork
 * between clients, and `proofRequirements: []` is documented there as a valid
 * value meaning "any evidence accepted". Enforcing these on web alone would
 * reject gigs mobile accepts. If we want them, they belong in shared and
 * apply to both.
