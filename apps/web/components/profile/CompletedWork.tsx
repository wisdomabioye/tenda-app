/**
 * The Settings & Profile comp's "Work you have done" block: one chip per gig
 * category the user has actually delivered in, with how many times.
 *
 * RENDERS NOTHING WHEN THERE IS NOTHING, like VerifiedBlock beside it. The
 * endpoint returns only categories with work behind them, so an empty answer
 * is a whole absent block rather than five chips reading zero — a profile
 * claiming "Delivery 0 · Creative 0" says less than one that says nothing, and
 * says it about a brand-new account in the least generous way available.
 *
 * THE HEADING FOLLOWS THE READER, not the route. The comp writes "Work you
 * have done", which is only true on your own profile; the same component is on
 * /profile/[id], where a stranger is reading. Derived from the session rather
 * than passed per route because /profile/<your own id> is reachable and is
 * still your work.
