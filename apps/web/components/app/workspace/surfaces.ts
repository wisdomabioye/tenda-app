/**
 * The workspace surface/selection contract.
 *
 * A "surface" is the first path segment inside the (app) group — /messages,
 * /my-gigs, /wallet. Everything deeper identifies WHICH row of that surface is
 * open, and that is the "selection".
 *
 *   /messages              surface=messages  selection=none
 *   /messages/abc-123      surface=messages  selection=abc-123
 *   /settings/security     surface=settings  selection=security
 *
 * Two things read this contract:
 *   - the detail pane, for its accessible name and its focus hand-off (a
 *     changed selection moves focus, which is what makes the ≤900px
 *     single-pane collapse usable);
 *   - the @list parallel-route slot, which supplies a surface's list column.
 *     Adding a list to a surface is `app/(app)/@list/<surface>/page.tsx` PLUS
 *     a `SURFACE_LIST_HOME` entry below — no layout edit. The entry was
 *     already required for the ≤900px back link; since AppWorkspace also
 *     reads it to decide whether to render the slot at all, a list without one
 *     now renders nowhere. `list-registry.test.ts` fails on the omission
 *     rather than leaving it to be found on a phone.

 * the detail pane renders no back link at all — there is nothing behind it.
 *
 * That last sentence is now load-bearing in a second place: AppWorkspace asks
 * this map whether to render the @list slot, because the slot itself cannot
 * answer it (Next retains an unmatched slot's last subpage across a soft
 * navigation). Keep the map exhaustive; the drift guard is
