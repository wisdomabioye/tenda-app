/**
 * The card every auth step renders inside — one look for the whole flow
 * (Auth comp: the same eyebrow / headline / lede stack on signin, email,
 * verify, profile and wallet).
 *
 * `width` exists because the comp genuinely varies it and the reason is
 * legible: 420px for a single field or a list of two, 460px where six OTP
 * cells have to sit on one line, 440px where two name fields sit side by side.
 * A named size rather than a raw class so the three are a decision recorded in
 * one place instead of three magic numbers in three files.
