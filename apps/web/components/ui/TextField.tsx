 * `text-base` and not `text-sm`, for a reason that only shows on a phone:
 * **iOS Safari zooms the whole viewport** when a focused input is set below
 * 16px, and it does not zoom back out. On the sign-in step that is a reader
 * typing their email into a page that has just jumped. Every comp specifies
 * `font-size:16px` on its inputs; this was 14px, measured. The vertical rhythm
 * is unchanged — `py-3` with a 24px line box gives the comps' 50px control.
