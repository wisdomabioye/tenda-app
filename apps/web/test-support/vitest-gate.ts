/**
 * What vitest's coverage gate actually instruments, answered by vitest's own
 * matcher rather than a lookalike.
 *
 * THE MATCHER IS THE PART WORTH GETTING RIGHT. A checker that disagrees with
 * the real gate is worse than no checker: it reports files as covered that are
 * not, or fails on files that are. So this asks `test-exclude` — which is what
 * `@vitest/coverage-v8` itself imports (its dist/provider.js does
 * `import TestExclude from 'test-exclude'`) — rather than re-deriving the glob
 * semantics. Two properties were verified against it directly, not assumed:
 *
 *   - it needs ABSOLUTE paths; a root-relative one answers false for
 *     everything, which would have made this whole check pass vacuously;
 *   - `app/(app)/profile/\[id\]/page.tsx` is GATED and the unescaped
 *     `app/(app)/profile/[id]/page.tsx` is NOT, reproducing the trap
 *     vitest.config.ts records — a Next dynamic segment is a glob character
 *     class, so an unescaped entry silently matches nothing while looking
 *     listed.
 *
 * PINNED TO THE PROVIDER'S VERSION, not the newest. web's package.json asks
 * for `test-exclude@^7.0.2` because that is what `@vitest/coverage-v8` resolves;
 * 8.0.0 exists upstream. Taking the newer one would quietly give this file a
 * different matcher from the gate it is checking, which is the single failure
 * mode that makes a checker worse than none. Bump it when the provider does.
 *
 * WHY NOT SHARED WITH MOBILE'S EQUIVALENT, which #69 asked to be decided rather
 * than assumed. The pure resolver next door IS duplicated from mobile's, and
 * that cost is real. It is not moved to @tenda/shared because shared is domain
 * logic with a zero-runtime-dependency charter and the SERVER consumes it — a
 * node:fs-touching build-tooling module there changes what shared is. And the
 * half that actually decides the answer is runner-specific on both sides
 * (jest-util's `globsToMatcher` over `collectCoverageFrom` there, `test-exclude`
 * over `coverage.include` here), so "sharing" would mean parameterising over
 * precisely the difference the checker exists to get right.
 *
 * #77 RE-EXAMINED THAT AND KEPT IT, against its own two triggers rather than by
 * taste. No third consumer: server, admin and tendahq have no coverage gate and
 * no test-support/ at all. And the pure half had not drifted — comparing the two
 * files function by function, with comments stripped and whitespace collapsed,
 * `toKey`, `isTestSupport`, `listFiles`, `resolveModule`, `ownerOf` and
 * `subjectByName` are byte-identical, including the `<= 0` fix in the last one.
 * Only `collectTestSubjects` and `subjectsByImport` differ, plus web's
 * `inTestsDirectory`, which mobile has no counterpart to because it takes the
 * matcher in — and all of that is the runner seam this note describes.
 *
 * What #77 added is the thing that makes "revisit on drift" keepable:
 * `__tests__/coverage-resolver-parity.test.ts` fails when a must-match function
 * stops matching, when either copy grows a function neither list classifies, or
 * when an allowance rots — its function having stopped differing, or having been
 * deleted from both copies. Before it, the copies could diverge and the only way
 * to find out was to read both files.
