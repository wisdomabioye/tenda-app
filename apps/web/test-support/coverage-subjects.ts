/**
 * Which modules the unit suite actually exercises.
 *
 * `coverage.include` in vitest.config.ts is an allow-list, so a file outside it
 * contributes nothing to the reported figures even when it has a full suite —
 * "web coverage is 98%" is a statement about the LISTED files, not about web.
 * #58 found that drift on mobile (110 of 191 exercised modules outside the
 * gate); #69 measured it here and found nine, all route pages under app/(app)/,
 * each with real cases whose subject could not move the number.
 *
 * Two signals, in order, and the ORDER is the design:
 *
 *   BY NAME — a suite tests the module of the same name in the directory it
 *   belongs to: `hooks/gig/__tests__/useFoo.test.ts` -> `hooks/gig/useFoo.ts`.
 *   Suffixed splits count too (`useFoo.races.test.ts` -> `useFoo.ts`), because
 *   that is how the big suites here were split.
 *
 *   BY IMPORT — a suite named for a THEME rather than a module
 *   (`app/(app)/settings/__tests__/settings-index.test.tsx`) declares its
 *   subjects by importing them. Only imports landing inside the owning
 *   directory count, at any depth; anything outside it is a collaborator.
 *
 * The by-import signal is the FALLBACK, not an addition. Applied to every suite
 * it re-labels every shared component a sibling's test happens to render.
 *
 * DUPLICATED FROM apps/mobile/test-support/coverage-subjects.ts, deliberately —
 * see test-support/vitest-gate.ts for the reasoning and the follow-up task. The
 * pure path logic is the same; what differs is how each runner is asked what it
 * gates, and that is the half worth getting right per-app.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated because a checker that overclaims is worse than none: a
 * theme-named suite whose subject it does not import — through a helper, or a
 * barrel two directories up — resolves to nothing and is reported as
 * unresolved rather than silently counted.
