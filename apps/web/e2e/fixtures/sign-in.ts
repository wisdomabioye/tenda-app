/**
 * Walking the real sign-in flow, in ONE place.
 *
 * Seven spec files had their own copy of these four lines, each hardcoding the
 * button label — so renaming one CTA during the #14 port failed every authed
 * test in the suite at once, for a reason that had nothing to do with what any
 * of them was testing. The labels come from `AUTH_COPY` here, which is the
 * same source the pages render from, so a copy change moves both together.
 *
 * This deliberately drives the UI rather than seeding a token: these helpers
 * run before tests that assume a session, and a session obtained by a route
 * the product does not have would let a broken sign-in ship green.
 *
 * WHICH ONE TO REACH FOR. A spec that is not about signing in wants
 * `signInToHome` — the shortest real path, straight to /signin/email, so it
 * couples to nothing it does not test. `signInFromChooser` exists for specs
 * that mean to exercise the chooser, and `auth-session.spec.ts` is the one that
 * does. (Before this fixture, `wallet-surfaces` walked the chooser only because
 * its local copy happened to; the choice is explicit now rather than inherited.)
