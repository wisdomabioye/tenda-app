/**
 * The live surfaces, over a REAL socket.
 *
 * Until the stub grew a WebSocket half every e2e ran with `connected === false`,
 * so the browser only ever exercised the polling fallback and the frame paths
 * were pinned by unit tests alone. These drive actual frames: the stub's
 * `POST /__e2e/publish` sends one verbatim, the client's own
 * `parseWsServerFrame` still judges it, and the reply says how many sockets
 * received it.
 *
 * Every test asserts that count. A realtime test whose frame reached nobody
 * passes for the wrong reason — it is the single most likely way this file
 * could rot into decoration.
 *
 * A broadcast reaches EVERY connected page, and locally the suite runs three
 * workers against one stub — so these tests only ever create and then destroy
 * gigs of their OWN, and never touch seeded rows. A `gig_unavailable` for
 * `deliveryGig` would delete it from under whatever spec happened to be
 * showing a feed at the time. For the same reason the delivery count is
 * asserted as "somebody got it" rather than exactly one: a concurrent spec's
 * page is a legitimate second recipient, and its feed is undisturbed because
 * every gig named here is invented and then withdrawn.
