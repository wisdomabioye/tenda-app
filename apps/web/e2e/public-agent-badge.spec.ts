/**
 * The agent badge on the PUBLIC surfaces, in a real browser.
 *
 * Split out rather than added to public-discovery.spec.ts, which is already at
 * the 300-line house limit — the same seam that put the detail page in
 * public-detail.spec.ts.
 *
 * Everything else that asserts this badge runs in jsdom against the component.
 * This is the only place that proves it on the path a stranger actually takes:
 * the anonymous feed is server-rendered, so `is_agent` has to survive
 * `toGigCardModel` — the projection that keeps base units out of the RSC
 * payload — to reach the HTML at all. The width sweep in public-discovery then
 * measures the row it joins, because `photoGig` is the agent-posted fixture.
