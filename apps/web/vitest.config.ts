     * Vitest defaults to one worker per core minus one — 11 on a 12-core box —
     * and this file previously declared no worker config at all, so that is
     * what it ran. `apps/mobile/jest.config.js` records the same number as
     * MEASURED-unstable for jest, with an A/B behind it; web was sitting at
     * exactly that width with nobody having checked.
     *
     * WHAT #34 ESTABLISHED, and what it did not.
     *
     * Reproduced, with the identity captured — the thing three earlier
     * occurrences lost to an output filter. Under a deliberate CPU load, one
     * COMPLETE run (213 s, 1884 of 1885 tests passing) failed exactly one:
     *     FeedRail > offers every category in the shared vocabulary…
     *     → Test timed out in 5000 ms, at 5399 ms
     * Two further runs failed the same test first (6180 / 5521 ms), but the
     * machine was degrading by then — the second showed unrelated tests at
     * 28-31 s — so they corroborate rather than measure.
     *
     * That test takes 330 ms running its own suite in isolation. So it is not
     * a slow test: it is a starved one, missing a deadline that already
     * carries ~15x headroom. Which is why the fix is FEWER WORKERS and not a
     * bigger timeout — raising the budget would only hide a test that
     * genuinely got slow. (The two GigWizard suites keep their scoped 20 s
     * bump: those really do drive five wizard steps.)
     *
     * STILL NOT MEASURED: that '50%' survives the same CPU LOAD the failure
     * was reproduced under. That run was stopped — it took the machine down —
     * and it must not be retaken on a machine anyone is using. The idle rows
     * BELOW are half of that comparison, not a substitute for it; what
     * carries the rest is mobile's A/B (11 workers failed 2 of 3 runs under
     * load, '50%' passed 10 of 10). If this flakes again, the loaded arm is
     * the first thing to go and get, on a machine nobody is using.
     *
     * WHAT THE CAP ACTUALLY BUYS, measured idle with no synthetic load —
     * the same full suite, run both ways:
     *
     *   wall clock   11 workers  102.1 / 80.3 / 87.6 s
     *                 6 workers   87.5 / 93.6 s
     *   canary SUITE 11 workers  8084 / 5154 / 7481 ms
     *                 6 workers  2999 / 4837 ms      (2690 ms in isolation)
     *
     * Wall clock is a WASH — the ranges overlap and there is no speed case
     * here, unlike mobile, where fewer workers was also faster. What does not
     * overlap is the second row: the heavy suite runs at roughly its isolated
     * speed at 6 workers and at ~3x inflation at 11. That is the whole point,
     * because the failure is a PER-TEST deadline, not a total: contention
     * inside a heavy suite is what eats a 5000 ms budget, and the cap is what
     * gives it back.
     *
     * PLAYWRIGHT NEEDS NO MATCHING CHANGE, checked rather than assumed: it
     * already reports "125 tests using 6 workers", i.e. the half-the-cores
     * default this now matches. The asymmetry #34 suspected was real and it
     * was one-sided — vitest at 11 beside playwright at 6.
     *
     * A percentage rather than a fixed count so a 2-core CI runner gets 1
     * worker instead of the 6 a fixed count would over-subscribe it with.
