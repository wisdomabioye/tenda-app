/**
 * The wallet guide page renders the SHARED array in its own order, and that
 * order is a product decision (EVM leads, Celo first inside it) rather than an
 * accident of how the file was typed. Three things here are only true on this
 * surface and so cannot be asserted in the shared content suite:
 *
 *   - the FIRST card is the one open on arrival (`defaultOpen={i === 0}`), so
 *     the reader who never scrolls sees the EVM wallets;
 *   - the badge reaches the DOM at all. Mobile has always drawn it; web
 *     dropped it, which quietly turned "these are tested" into "these exist";
 *   - the Celo gas warning sits INSIDE its own card, so the Solana cards do
 *     not tell a reader to go and hold CELO.
 *
 * Queried through the `<details>` elements rather than by ARIA role: the
 * accordion is native `<details>/<summary>` on purpose (the answers belong in
 * the HTML on an anonymous page), and jsdom does not map those to the roles a
 * `getByRole` query would need.
