/**
 * Fee calculator island — mirrors mobile's escrow-guide calculator.
 *
 * The arithmetic is shared `computePlatformFeeRaw`, the SAME function the
 * server's fee path and `useEscrowFee` call, and it is BigInt floor division
 * over base units because that is what the on-chain contract does. This page
 * used to do `amount * (pct / 100)` in floating point and print it at four
 * decimal places, which is round-half-up over display units — a different rule
 * from the chain's, on the one page whose entire job is telling someone what
 * the fee will be. `parseUnits`/`formatUnits` move between the two
 * representations; nothing here multiplies or divides a float.
 *
 * The RATE is deliberately still the static `APP_INFO.fees.platformFeePct`
 * rather than live platform config: that constant is documented as static copy
 * for exactly these support surfaces, and `SUPPORT_FEE_NOTE` says the rate can
 * change. Live surfaces read the config endpoint through `useEscrowFee`. Only
 * the arithmetic was forked; the source of the rate was already right.
 *
 * Amounts are USDC because USDC is the settlement unit, and the asset is now
 * NAMED: the floor happens at the asset's precision, so a calculator that hides
 * which asset it means is hiding the thing that decides its last digit.
