/**
 * OTP entry (mobile's verify-code, sign-in mode). Auto-verifies at 6 digits,
 * clears the field on failure, 60s resend cooldown carried in the flow store
 * so navigation does not reset it. Success routes by the server's own
 * profile-complete predicate: /home or /onboarding/profile.
 *
 * The expiry the comp asks for is the SERVER's `expires_in`, carried through
 * the flow store — not a constant this app would have to keep in step with the
 * OTP service by hand. When it runs out the page says so and stops offering to
 * verify, because a code the server has already dropped cannot be typed
 * correctly and letting someone try is a worse answer than telling them.
 *
 * The "Verify" CTA is never clickable, and that is the design rather than an
 * oversight: reaching six digits submits, so the button is disabled below six
 * and disabled again the instant it would not be. What it does is REPORT —
 * "Verifying…" is the only feedback that the auto-submit started. Mobile's
 * verify-code screen has the identical pair, so this is the product's pattern
 * and not a web artefact. Coverage will show its onClick unreached; a test
 * that reached it would have to fake a state the page cannot enter.
