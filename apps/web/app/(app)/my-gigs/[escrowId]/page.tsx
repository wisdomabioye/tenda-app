/**
 * The authed escrow detail — the workspace's dossier pane (Tier 2 comp,
 * lines 497-713), and the surface `EscrowDossier` was built for in #9.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND URL EXISTS FOR ONE ESCROW (user decision, 2026-08-17). The
 * public `/gig/[id]` stays the canonical, indexable, unfurlable address: it
 * server-renders the listing anonymously and its client island adds the party
 * half once a bearer loads. That page belongs to the PUBLIC shell, so a reader
 * who opened a gig from their own list left the workspace and the list column
 * went with them — a column that vanishes when you use it is not a column.
 *
 * The rules that keep the two from drifting:
 *   - both read the SAME endpoint through the same store, and the party half
 *     comes from the server's scoping, never from a local role check;
 *   - both render the same action island (`GigDetailAuthed`), so a transition
 *     offered here is the same one offered there;
 *   - this one is authed-only. `AuthGate` sends a signed-out visitor to
 *     /signin before this page renders at all, so nothing here is public and
 *     nothing crawls it. The address to SHARE is the public one; a
 *     /my-gigs/<id> link handed to someone signed out lands them on sign-in
 *     and — until the gate remembers where they were going (task #27) — not
 *     on the gig afterwards.
