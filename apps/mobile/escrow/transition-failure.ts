/**
 * How a transition failure REACHES the user — extracted from useEscrowActions
 * so the hook stays inside the size budget and this stays readable as one
 * decision: which failures are routed, which are expected exits, which stale
 * the screen, and which are simply reported.
 *
 * The ordering is load-bearing and is the whole reason this is one function
 * rather than four checks scattered through a catch block.
 *
 * A root domain folder, mirroring `wallet/`, rather than `hooks/escrow/`: this
 * is not a hook, and `hooks/` should read as the place hooks are. Not `lib/`
 * either — nothing in there reaches the UI at runtime (media-download.ts takes
 * a TYPE from components and that is the extent of it), while surfacing a
 * toast and a route is this function's entire job.
