 * jest-expo harness (#101). Strategy: heavy native transports (Solana MWA,
 * @solana/web3.js, WalletConnect/Reown) and storage (AsyncStorage,
 * expo-secure-store) are MOCKED in jest.setup.js / per-test, so the suite
 * exercises OUR logic, not the SDKs, which also sidesteps having to transform
 * those packages. `transformIgnorePatterns` therefore only needs to whitelist
 * the RN/Expo/UI packages our components actually render.
 *
 * pnpm caveat: real packages resolve through node_modules/.pnpm/<pkg>@<ver>/…,
 * so the whitelist matches on the `.pnpm/<pkg>@` segment, not a bare
 * `node_modules/<pkg>` prefix.

   * Jest defaults to one worker per core minus one — 11 on a 12-core box — and
   * at that width the workers starve each other badly enough to fail tests.
   *
   * The failures did NOT look like contention, which is why they read as
   * flakiness for so long. RTL's `waitFor` deadline is 1000ms
   * (asyncUtilTimeout, five times tighter than jest's 5000ms testTimeout), and
   * on expiry it rethrows its LAST ASSERTION rather than a timeout message. A
   * starved worker therefore reports
   *     expect(received).toBe(expected)  Expected: false  Received: true
   * from a `waitFor(() => expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false))` — an
   * assertion that looks like a logic race, in whichever test happened to be
   * running. Reproduced exactly by setting asyncUtilTimeout to 1ms.
   *
   * MEASURED on a 12-core box, full suite (180 suites / 1548 tests):
   *   workers   wall time        runs failed
   *   11 (dflt) 20.9 – 34.7 s    1 / 5
   *    8        13.3 – 22.3 s    0 / 3
   *    6 (50%)  11.0 – 12.2 s    0 / 3
   *    4        10.8 – 12.6 s    0 / 5
   *    3        12.3 – 12.8 s    0 / 3
   *    2        14.6 – 15.0 s    0 / 3
   * Fewer workers is both FASTER and stable; the knee is 4–6. `'50%'` rather
   * than a fixed count because jest floors a percentage to at least 1 worker
   * (jest-config/getMaxWorkers), so a 2-core CI runner gets 1 instead of the
   * 4 a fixed count would over-subscribe it with.
   *
   * CONFIRMED with this config, no flags: 10/10 green in 9.8 – 12.0 s idle.
   * Then a controlled A/B under 8 CPU hogs (load avg ~23–30), same load both
   * ways: 11 workers failed 2 of 3 runs, '50%' passed 10 of 10.
   *
   * The timeouts are deliberately NOT raised. The four suites that failed run
   * in 2.3s TOTAL when not starved, so the 1000ms deadline already carries
   * ~100x headroom — raising it would only hide a test that genuinely got slow.
