/**
 * What the coverage gate measures — the allow-list itself, extracted from
 * jest.config.js in #75 when gating the harness took that file past the
 * 300-line house rule.
 *
 * A long register with its provenance written down belongs in its own module;
 * its sibling coverage-ungated.ts sits here for the same reason. jest.config.js
 * keeps the thresholds and the runner settings, which is what a reader opens
 * it for.
 *
 * COMMONJS AND `.js`, deliberately: jest reads its config before any transform
 * is available, so the config cannot `require` a `.ts` file. That also puts
 * this module outside `test-support/*.ts` and therefore outside the coverage
 * gate — correct rather than unfortunate, since it is an array of strings with
 * nothing to execute. The behaviour that matters is asserted anyway:
 * __tests__/coverage-gate.test.ts reads `config.collectCoverageFrom` and fails
 * on a pattern that matches nothing.
 */

/**
 * An ALLOW-LIST: a file that is not matched here contributes nothing to the
 * figures the gate reports, however well tested it is. That is deliberate —
 * mobile has screens and native-adjacent modules impractical to cover, and a
 * catch-all pattern over every ts/tsx file would drop the global far under
 * 90 and force a threshold cut, which is a worse number than an honest
 * narrow one.
 *
 * What is NOT deliberate is a file quietly staying outside it. #49, #51 and
 * #56 each found one by accident. __tests__/coverage-gate.test.ts now fails
 * when a suite lands on an unlisted module, and the register in
 * `coverage-ungated.ts` beside this file records the ones that are outside it
 * today. That list cannot grow without someone editing it in a reviewed diff.
 *
 * No count is quoted for that register here, on purpose: this paragraph used to
 * say "the 109", the register holds 108, and a number in prose that nothing
 * checks drifts exactly like that (#75).
 *
 * The same test also fails on a pattern here that matches NOTHING. #58 found
 * seven, every one of them a module that had moved into @tenda/shared with
 * its pattern left behind — the failure mode to expect, since a module
 * leaving the app looks exactly like a module that was never listed.
 *
 * Before adding a file here, MEASURE with it listed. Every entry below that
 * says "measured" earned it that way — and re-measure before trusting one,
 * because stores/realtime.store.ts sat out of the gate on a reading that had
 * stopped being true.
