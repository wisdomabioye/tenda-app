/**
 * Files the unit suite exercises that the coverage gate cannot see — the
 * recorded, shrinking exception list behind __tests__/coverage-gate.test.ts.
 *
 * WHY A LIST AND NOT A RULE. #58 asked for "every tested file must be in the
 * gate". Enforced literally that breaks the build on changes that strictly ADD
 * tests: a file can gain its first suite and still be too thinly covered to
 * carry the global threshold. `stores/realtime.store.ts` was the worked
 * example when #56 measured it at 89.96% against a threshold of 90 — it is in
 * the gate now, because #58 re-measured and the floor had moved, but the shape
 * of the problem it demonstrated has not gone away. A hard rule would demand
 * either a threshold cut or a second task's worth of tests smuggled into the
 * first, on whichever file hits that state next.
 *
 * So the gate ratchets instead. Every entry below is a file whose code runs
 * under test today and counts for nothing in the reported figures. The test
 * does not make this list unable to grow — it makes it unable to grow QUIETLY:
 * a new suite on an unlisted file fails coverage-gate.test.ts on the spot, and
 * the only way past is to add a line here, in a diff someone reviews. Entries
 * LEAVE by being listed in `collectCoverageFrom`; the same test fails on an
 * entry that is now gated, on one whose file is gone, and on one nothing
 * exercises any more, so an exemption cannot outlive its reason.
 *
 * The bar for a NEW entry: measure `pnpm --filter tenda-mobile test:cov` with
 * the file gated first. If the thresholds hold, gate it and do not come here.
 * Only a measured drop earns a new line, and the measurement goes in a comment
 * beside it.
 *
 * The SEED is not held to that bar and does not claim to be. It is the drift
 * as it stood when #58 measured it, less what has left since — 108 entries
 * against 83 gated subjects, so the headline figure still describes well under
 * half of what the suite executes.
 * Not one of them carries a measurement, because not one had been measured:
 * the only file that HAD been, stores/realtime.store.ts, was re-measured
 * during #58's audit, came out above the threshold, and went into the gate
 * instead of onto this list. Treat every line here as un-measured backlog
 * rather than as a finding that it cannot be gated. Adding to it is a decision
 * to be argued for in review; shrinking it needs no argument at all.
