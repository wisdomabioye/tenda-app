/**
 * The ordinary-lifecycle half: everything an escrow offers regardless of how
 * it was taken up.
 *
 * Returns a SET, not a winner. Most states really do offer more than one legal
 * move — approve or dispute, claim or add proof or dispute — and the previous
 * shape encoded those pairs by hand inside individual branches, which is how
 * "+ Dispute" ended up copied into five of them and then silently dropped from
 * a sixth. Each rule below stands alone; the bar arranges them by slot.
 *
 * Every rule mirrors a guard `assertCanTransition` re-checks, INCLUDING the
 * deadlines. A button the server would 409 is not a smaller bug than a missing
 * one — it just fails later.
