/**
 * The gig detail's approval-mode plumbing: which sheet or dialog an approval
 * action opens, and what confirming it does.
 *
 * Extracted so the screen stays a view. It also puts the one distinction that
 * matters in a single place — `unassign` is the ONLY approval action that
 * opens a wallet, so it goes back to the screen's transaction gate, while
 * apply/withdraw/release are off-chain and confirm through the styled
 * ConfirmDialog instead (never TxConfirmDialog, which promises a wallet, and
 * never Alert.alert, per convention).
