/**
 * A bordered, tinted strip that tells the user something about the screen they
 * are on — not about something they just did (that is `showToast`) and not
 * something they must answer (that is `ConfirmDialog`).
 *
 * Extracted because the same icon + headline + body + feedback-tone box had
 * been hand-rolled per feature, and the copies had already drifted in padding
 * and radius. `DraftsBanner` and `NotificationNudgeBanner` are deliberately NOT
 * folded in: both are pressables carrying their own affordances (a chevron, a
 * dismiss), so they are different components that happen to look similar.
 *
 * The tone maps straight onto `theme.colors.feedback`, so a banner cannot
 * invent a colour that is not already in the palette.
