 * Keep the field honest across the two edges that move underneath it.
 *
 * RATE ARRIVES for a budget typed while it was unknown (#49). The early return
 * in handleChangeText is correct — converting a fiat number as if it were asset
 * units would misprice by ~1500x — but on its own it only declined to emit.
 * Nothing re-ran once the rate landed, so a budget typed during the rates
 * request stayed on screen with "Set a budget" underneath it: a number shown
 * and not counted, the same dishonesty #32 removed for a trailing point.
 *
 * DENOMINATION CHANGES (#66). Keying only on the rate conflated these two. A
 * currency switch used to be handled one of two ways depending on cache state:
 * to an UNCACHED currency the rate passed through null, the transition fired,
 * and the typed number was re-read as the new currency; to a CACHED one nothing
 * re-ran at all, so the emitted raw stayed the OLD currency's valuation under a
 * suffix already reading the new one (NGN->KES both cached: 150000 on screen, a
 * budget of 100 USDC rather than 1000). Same gesture, two budgets, decided by
 * what happened to be in the cache.
 *
 * OPTION (b), chosen by the product owner over re-pricing (a) and clearing (c):
 * the budget is PRESERVED and the field is RESTATED. A currency change says how
 * the money is written down, not how much it is — so the RAW becomes the source
 * of truth and `onChange` is never called. (a) would move what the gig is worth
 * by the rate ratio while the reader watched; (c) would throw away a budget they
 * had already set.
 *
 * WHICH SIDE IS AUTHORITATIVE therefore depends on which edge fired:
 *   denomination changed -> the RAW is the truth, restate the text;
 *   rate merely arrived  -> the TEXT is the truth, convert it and emit.
 *
 * The restatement can outlive its render: a switch to a currency with no cached
 * rate cannot honestly show a number, so the field blanks and `awaiting` carries
 * the intent to the render where the rate lands. The budget survives that gap
 * untouched, so the step stays satisfied throughout — and the reader may type
 * into the blank while they wait, in which case their number wins and the
 * restatement is abandoned.
