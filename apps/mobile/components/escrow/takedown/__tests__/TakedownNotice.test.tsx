/**
 * The takedown banner: whether it appears, and who it is speaking to.

 * opposite things said. The poster has to learn their listing is off the board
 * AND that their money is not; the worker has to hear that nothing about their
 * job changed. Getting those two backwards would tell a worker their gig was
 * pulled and leave them thinking they will not be paid.
