/**
 * The banner a taken-down escrow shows at the top of its detail screen.

 * Renders NOTHING when the escrow is visible, so both detail bodies mount it
 * unconditionally and neither carries a `hidden &&` of its own.
 *
 * The audience is worked out from ids the wire already carries — creator,
 * counterparty, assignee — and never from a role. The detail routes read no
 * role either (their JWT claim can be a token lifetime stale, see
 * server lib/escrow-detail-scope.ts), so "not a party" is exactly the reader
 * those routes let through on a role check: a moderator.

/**
 * The parts of a detail wire this reads. Structural, so `GigDetail` and
 * `ExchangeDetail` both satisfy it without either importing the other — the
 * same shape-not-name approach as shared's `EscrowDetailLike`.
 *
 * Taken as ONE object rather than four id props on purpose: `viewerId`,
 * `creatorId`, `counterpartyId` and `assignedCounterpartyId` are all `string`,
 * so a caller that swapped two of them would compile cleanly and quietly show
 * the wrong audience the wrong message. Passing the escrow removes that failure
 * mode instead of testing for it at every call site.
