 * A person as the cards in this folder take them.

 * optional and the SHAPE is the discriminator:
 *
 *   - a `UserRef` (gigs, buyers, reviewers) carries the two nullable name
 *     columns and nothing else;
 *   - an `ExchangePartyRef` (#175) carries no columns at all — the server
 *     already decided how much of that person this viewer may see and sends
 *     `display_name` ("Wisdom A.") plus `full_name`, which is filled only for a
 *     settled party to that escrow.
 *
 * Keeping both here means a card never re-derives an identity, and adding a
 * third shape is one branch in one function rather than an edit to every
 * component that draws a face and a name.
