 * ended in the same dead screen: a late SUCCESS for gig-1 replaced gig-2 (the
 * gate renders only when the id matches, so it showed a spinner), and a late
 * FAILURE overwrote gig-2's error slot (the gate ignores another gig's error,
 * so it showed a spinner). Either way: no data, no error, nothing in flight,
