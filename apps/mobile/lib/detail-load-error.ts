/**
 * Why a detail screen's load failed, and whether what it was showing is still
 * worth keeping on screen.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole point. A detail store that blanks itself on ANY
 * failure tears a good screen off on one flaky request; one that never blanks —
 * which is what both gig and exchange did — keeps rendering a listing the
 * server has stopped serving, with every action button live. Neither is a
 * refresh policy; the status code is.
 *
 * `gone` means the server answered "not to you": the row was deleted, or it is
 * a draft or a CO1 takedown the caller may no longer read. Retrying that will
 * fail forever, so callers drop what they hold and say so. Everything else —
 * offline, timeout, 500, a rate limit — is transient: keep the screen, offer a
 * retry.
 *
 * Mirrors lib/dispute-send-error.ts: classification lives beside the codes it
 * compares, once, rather than as an `instanceof` in each screen.
