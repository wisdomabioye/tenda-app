/**
 * Chain-agnostic wallet utilities (post-#34). Wallet CONNECTIONS live in
 * the promoted adapter stack (adapters/* behind the WalletAdapter interface);
 * sign-in/link orchestration lives in auth.ts; unsigned-tx signing +
 * client-ping live in dispatch.ts. Balance READS converged onto
 * @tenda/shared's fetch-based readers (2026-08-15) — the web3.js Connection
 * this module used to construct at import time is gone with them. This
 * module re-exports the single-source chain config and owns the Solana tx
 * status read (the canonical homes are ./config and ./solana-rpc, prefer
 * those in new code).
 *
 * The legacy MWA + idl/legacy escrow flow died at the cutover, escrow
 * transactions are built server-side (/v1/escrows) and signed via
 * dispatch.signSendAndReport.
