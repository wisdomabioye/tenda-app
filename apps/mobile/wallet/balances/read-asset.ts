/**
 * ONE asset's balance on ONE chain — the targeted counterpart to
 * `readWalletBalances`' fan-out. Costs a single RPC (the reader's `assetIds`
 * filter), which is what makes it usable as a blocking pre-flight before a
 * transaction rather than only as screen furniture.
 *
 * Returns null when the balance is UNKNOWN — the asset isn't on this chain,
 * or the read failed/timed out. Callers must not read null as "zero": the two
 * are opposite outcomes and conflating them would block a funded user. The
 * reader's own timeout bounds this; it never hangs.
