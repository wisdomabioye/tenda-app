 * Pre-flight balance check for value-moving escrow transactions (create,

 * signer, mirroring the `wallet/allowance` module's shape: reads over the
 * chain's public RPC, throws a typed WalletError, and knows nothing about any
 * particular screen.
 *
 * NOT a security control — the chain is the authority (the escrow's
 * transferFrom / msg.value check reverts an underfunded call regardless). This
 * exists so the user learns they're short BEFORE a wallet prompt, a permit
 * signature, and a draft they'd have to retry.
 *
 * Deliberately FAIL-OPEN: an unreadable balance is NOT insufficient. This is
 * the opposite of `readAllowance`, and the asymmetry is intentional — a failed
 * allowance read costs one spurious approve prompt, whereas treating an RPC
 * hiccup as "no funds" would block a fully-funded user from posting. Every
 * failure path here lands on exactly the pre-existing behaviour: proceed, and
 * let the chain decide. The check can only ever stop a transaction it
 * positively read as short.

 * note above).
 *
 * Why the whole set and not just the likely signer: the signing wallet isn't
 * fixed until the wallet app opens — on EVM, `ensureEvmSession` can re-point
 * the signer at whichever linked wallet the user connects. Reading one wallet
 * would let a user with two linked wallets be told "you hold 0" while their
 * other wallet — and the wallet screen's headline — says otherwise. "The
 * primary is short" is not the same claim as "you cannot fund this", and only
 * the second one earns a block.
 *
 * `owners` is passed in rather than resolved here: the signer set lives behind
 * `resolveSignersForChain` in the tx layer, and importing that would pull the
 * WalletConnect native ESM into this module. An empty set (no linked wallet)
 * falls open — the 9D transaction gate owns that case and routes the user to
 * link one.
 *
 * Comparison is BigInt-exact. Base units routinely exceed Number.MAX_SAFE_
 * INTEGER (1 ETH = 1e18), so a numeric compare here would silently mis-answer
 * for 18-decimal assets.
