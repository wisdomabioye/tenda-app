/**
 * Kind-agnostic escrow action hook (cutover §6), ONE implementation of
 * the v2 client leg shared by the gig and exchange detail screens:
 *
 *   request unsigned tx (escrow.store) → sign + broadcast + client-ping
 *   (wallet/dispatch) → TransactionMonitor/WS confirms → screen refreshes.
 *
 * Proof submission is two-phase: the proof FILES go to the off-chain
 * satellite (POST /v1/escrows/:id/proofs) first, then the on-chain submit
 * commits a digest over the escrow's whole stored set, read back from the
 * server (see `attachedProofUrls`) rather than taken from the batch just
 * picked. The digest is sha256 over the '\n'-joined URLs, encoded base58 for
 * Solana chains, 0x-hex for EVM (matching SubmitEscrowProofBody's per-chain
 * format).
