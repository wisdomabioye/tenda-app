/**
 * usePaginatedList — the two races that only show up when a response and the
 * user disagree about what the list currently is.
 *
 * Both branches were uncovered: the suite proved the hook drops a stale
 * SUCCESS, but never that it drops a stale FAILURE, and it exercised realtime
 * updates that changed the count but never one that did not. Split into its
 * own file because the main suite is already well past the 300-line limit.
