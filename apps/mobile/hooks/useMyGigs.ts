/**
 * My-Gigs controller: the caller's Posted, Working and Drafts listings, each
 * independently paginated, plus the shared chain filter.
 *
 * Drafts are their OWN list rather than rows mixed into Posted. `mine=created`
 * returns every status including `draft`, so a single list forced a choice
 * between showing drafts (they are only reachable here) and counting them
 * (a pre-signature staging row is not a posted gig). Splitting the query lets
 * each tab's chip stay exactly its own server `total` — no derived arithmetic,
 * no extra count request, and no chip that disagrees with the rows under it.
 *
 * ALL lists load on mount rather than only the active tab. That is what
 * fixes the inactive tab's count chip reading 0 until it was swiped to
 * (open_issues MB2) — the chips now read the server `total` for a list that
 * has actually been fetched, instead of the length of an array nobody
 * populated. `total` also stays correct once the list pages, where
 * `items.length` would mean "loaded so far".
 *
 * All lists also re-read page 0 on every LATER focus. My Gigs is a tab, so it
 * stays mounted for the rest of the session: without this, posting a gig,
 * accepting one, or deleting a draft left both the rows AND the count chips
 * (which read the server `total`) showing pre-action state indefinitely.
 * Publishing a draft moves a row BETWEEN two of these lists, so the refresh
 * has to cover every one of them, not just the visible tab.
