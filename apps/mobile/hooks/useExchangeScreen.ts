/**
 * Trade-screen controller: the public order book and the caller's own trades,
 * each independently paginated, plus the shared currency/chain filters.
 *
 * Both pages own their loading state, which fixes the pager sharing ONE
 * `refreshing` flag (the spinner used to appear on the tab you weren't
 * refreshing). Fetching is driven purely by the list controllers' query
 * effects — the old screen called its loaders from `scrollToPage` AND from a
 * `useFocusEffect` keyed on `pageIndex`, firing every tab switch twice.
 *
 * Both pages do re-read page 0 on every LATER focus, though. Trade is a tab, so
 * it stays mounted for the session: without it, posting an offer or accepting
 * one left the order book and My Trades showing pre-action state indefinitely.
