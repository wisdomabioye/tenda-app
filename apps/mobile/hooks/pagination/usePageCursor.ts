/**
 * Where the next page starts — the offset/cursor half of usePaginatedList,
 * split out at #54 so the hook stops sitting exactly on the 300-line limit.
 * Mirrors web's hooks/pagination/usePageCursor (#46), which is deliberate:
 * the two clients duplicate this hook on purpose (no React in @tenda/shared),
 * so the closer their SHAPE stays, the cheaper the next parity fix is.
 *
 * Two traversal modes behind one surface. OFFSET mode walks by count; CURSOR
 * mode sends the server's `next_cursor` and lets it decide, which is what
 * keeps traversal stable on a list shifting under the reader. The caller picks
 * with `cursorPagination` and then never branches on it again.
 *
 * Mutable state in refs, deliberately: every caller is an async closure that
 * must see the LIVE position, not the value captured when its render ran, and
 * the returned object is referentially stable so closing over it costs no
 * callback churn.
