/**
 * POST /v1/agent/demo-session — a bearer for the shared demo agent (#108).
 *
 * No body, no proof, no auth: this is the one door a reviewer with no wallet
 * can walk through, and it exists because every round-one reviewer met a 401
 * here instead. Answers the same `{ token, user, is_new }` a registration does,
 * so nothing downstream knows or cares that the session came from here.
 *
 * Rate-limited per IP, at 30/min: LOOSER than the registration beside it (10),
 * TIGHTER than the platform default (100 — plugins/rate-limit.ts). Looser than
 * registration because eight of the ten round-one reviewers were one operator's
 * fleet, and a strict per-IP limit would starve the very audience this serves,
 * while one call per reviewer leaves the ceiling far away. Tighter than the
 * default because the endpoint needs no credential at all, so it is the
 * cheapest thing on this server to hammer — though the damage is bounded
 * anyway: one indexed read, one token signature, and an account that can spend
 * nothing.
