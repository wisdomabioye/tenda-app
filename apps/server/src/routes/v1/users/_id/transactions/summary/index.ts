/**
 * GET /v1/users/:id/transactions/summary — lifetime USDC earned/spent.
 *
 * Separate from the paginated feed on purpose (open_issues MB1). The wallet
 * screen used to reduce over whichever page happened to be loaded and label
 * the result "lifetime": understated for anyone past the first page, and once
 * the feed paginates it would have climbed as the user scrolled. A total over
 * "all rows" cannot be derived from "one page", so it is its own aggregate —
 * and its own request, so paging the feed doesn't recompute it every time.
 *
 * The predicates mirror what the client used to compute, exactly:
 *   earned = chain-attested NET credits where the caller is COUNTERPARTY
 *            (approve | claim_stalled | resolve). Rows with no attested
 *            amount are SKIPPED, never estimated from the gross principal —
 *            the settlement-honesty rule (see project_settlement_amount_honesty).
 *   spent  = principal locked where the caller is CREATOR (create), falling
 *            back to the escrow's own amount when the tx row carries none.
