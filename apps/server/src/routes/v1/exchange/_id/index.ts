/**
 * GET /v1/exchange/:id, exchange detail (cutover §3 rewrite): escrows ⨝
 * exchange_details + creator/counterparty refs, proofs, dispute and
 * reviews. Read-only; transitions live under /v1/escrows/:id/*.
 *
 * Drafts are private staging rows (fiat-rails opens them; my-offers lists
 * them), visible to their CREATOR only, 404 to everyone else.
 *
 * ANONYMOUS-TOLERANT since #179: the preHandler is `identifyViewer`, not
 * `authenticate`, so a stranger reads the listing half and a signed-in party
 * still gets theirs. Two consequences, both inherited from the gig detail that
 * has worked this way all along:
 *   - a private row (draft or taken-down) escalates to the FULL `authenticate`
 *     before deciding, so suspended accounts are rejected there like everywhere
 *     else — and an anonymous caller gets the 404 directly, because a 401 would
 *     confirm the id exists.
 *   - disclosure is decided by PARTY MEMBERSHIP only, never by role.
 *     `identifyViewer` does a bare `jwtVerify`, so a role claim on this path can
 *     be up to a token lifetime out of date; `escrow-detail-scope`'s header sets
 *     out why gating disclosure on that would hand a demoted admin every
 *     escrow's private half for a week. Admins read escrows through the dossier.
