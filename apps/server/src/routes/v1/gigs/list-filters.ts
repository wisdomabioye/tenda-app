/**
 * GET /v1/gigs — turning the querystring into SQL.
 *
 * NOT a route. This directory has an index.ts, so @fastify/autoload loads only
 * that file and never registers siblings; see the note at the top of
 * routes/v1/admin/index.ts, which documents the same semantics for the
 * directory that relies on them.
 *
 * Split out because the list handler was almost entirely this: ~120 lines of
 * filter parsing wrapped around two queries. Every function here maps the
 * QUERYSTRING to SQL and nothing else, which makes them readable in isolation
 * and reachable from a test without a request — `queryConditions` takes the
 * chain registry as a parameter (a structural type, see lib/chain-filter)
 * precisely so that stays true. What is NOT here is anything needing the
 * REQUEST: the `mine` branch authenticates and reads `request.user`, so it
 * stays in the handler where the auth lives.
 *
 * Validation throws rather than returning an error value, matching every other
 * route helper — a bad filter is a 400 and there is nothing sensible to do
 * with a partially-parsed one. Because they all throw the SAME 400 and differ
 * only in the message, the ORDER they run in is behaviour; see the note on
 * `queryConditions`.
