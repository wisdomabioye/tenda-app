/**
 * Platform fees live in TWO places that nothing kept in step: each chain's contract
 * (what users are actually charged) and the `platform_config` row (what the app
 * displays and projects payouts from). This is the pure half of keeping them honest:
 * what a valid fee pair is, how to read every chain, and how to compare.
 *
 * The contract always charges its OWN stored value, so a disagreement can only ever
 * make the DISPLAYED estimate wrong, never a charge. That is why the comparison
 * only reports: nothing here writes, and a chain that cannot be read is UNKNOWN,
 * never a mismatch (an RPC blip must not page anyone about a fee).
