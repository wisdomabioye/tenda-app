/**
 * The BROADCAST half of a claim: sign the transfer, record it, put it on chain.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A JOB. The claim endpoint answers 202 and returns immediately;
 * reaching a chain is not something a user should hold a spinner for. The slot
 * is reserved synchronously — that is what makes double-paying impossible — and
 * only the money moves out of band.
 *
 * WHY IT NO LONGER CONFIRMS, which is the #58 rework. This job used to call one
 * `send()` that broadcast AND waited for confirmation, then interpret the
 * result. A wait that timed out was indistinguishable from a transfer that
 * failed, so the code had to guess, and both guesses cost real money: releasing
 * the slot paid users twice, keeping it stranded users who were never paid.
 *
 * The order below is the fix, and every step of it is load-bearing:
 *
 *   1. sign          — a signed transaction has its final reference, and no
 *                      money has moved.
 *   2. markSubmitted — that reference is now durable. A crash from here on is
 *                      recoverable, because something in the database points at
 *                      the transaction.
 *   3. broadcast     — money may now move.
 *   4. enqueue       — ./confirm asks the chain what became of it, and retries
 *                      for as long as the chain has no answer.
 *
 * Nothing in this file decides whether a transfer succeeded. It cannot: at the
 * moment it finishes, the chain does not know either.
