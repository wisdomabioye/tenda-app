/**
 * The CONFIRM half of a claim (#58): ask the chain what became of a transfer we
 * broadcast, and record the answer.
 *
 * This job exists so that nothing has to guess. Its predecessor waited for
 * confirmation inside the send call and turned a wait that timed out into a
 * verdict — which released slots whose money had already left, and stamped
 * grants for transfers that landed and failed. Here a confirmation that has not
 * happened is simply a job that runs again.
 *
 * THE ONLY THREE THINGS IT CAN DO, and each is driven by what the CHAIN said:
 *
 *   delivered  → stamp the grant, notify the user. Terminal.
 *   failed     → the chain attested that the money did not move. Release the
 *                slot so the user can claim again. Terminal.
 *   pending    → the chain has no answer. Retry, until the grant is older than
 *                GAS_SEED_UNRESOLVED_AFTER_MS, at which point stop asking and
 *                mark it `unresolved` for a person to settle.
 *
 * It never releases a slot on `pending`. That is the whole discipline: "no
 * answer" and "it failed" are different, and conflating them is what paid users
 * twice.
