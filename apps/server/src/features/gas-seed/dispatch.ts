/**
 * First-link native-gas seed (stage-1-onboarding.md, decision #16):
 * phone-verified users with a wallet on a seed-bearing chain receive a
 * one-time native-token grant. Chain-driven, a chain qualifies iff
 * `chains.gas_seed_amount_raw IS NOT NULL` — which db:seed writes from the
 * manifest's `gasSeedAmountRaw` — so adding a future chain is a manifest
 * entry + its env secrets + a re-seed, with no code change here, for any
 * namespace ./senders supports (since #53a, both of them).
 *
 * Idempotency: `gas_grants` PK (user_id, chain_id) + insert-before-send.
 * The grant row is claimed FIRST with a placeholder tx_ref; only the
 * claimer performs the transfer, then stamps the real tx_ref. CONCURRENT
 * calls therefore cannot double-pay: the loser of the insert race exits
 * without transferring.
 *
 * What that does NOT cover is a transfer whose OUTCOME is unknown. A sender
 * that throws — including on a receipt timeout — releases the slot so the
 * user is not permanently marked seeded for a transfer that never landed,
 * and a tx that lands after that release would be paid a second time. The
 * senders bound that window rather than eliminating it (see the receipt wait
 * in ./senders/evm.ts); the alternative, keeping the slot, strands the user
 * instead. Losing one seed to a slow chain is the cheaper failure.
 *
 * The transfer itself is behind `GasSeedSender` so tests run offline and
 * each chain's impl stays a leaf.
