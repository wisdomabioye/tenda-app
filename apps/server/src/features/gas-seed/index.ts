/**
 * First-link native-gas seed — the whole feature, in one directory.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A one-time native-token grant that lets a new user post, accept
 * and settle without first hunting for gas. Which chains qualify, how much, and
 * which hot wallet pays are all configuration (the shared CHAIN_MANIFEST plus
 * `CHAIN_<ID>_GAS_SEED_KEY`); this directory is the mechanism.
 *
 * ONE TRIGGER: the user asks. `./claim` is the whole entry point, and the
 * automatic first-link send it replaced is GONE (#53c-2 removed `./trigger`
 * and its two call sites in auth/link-wallet and auth/verify). Sending crypto
 * nobody asked for has gray area a claim does not — the recipient may not
 * notice it, may not want it, and the spend landed on everyone who ever linked
 * a wallet rather than on the people who came back.
 *
 * `dispatchGasSeeds` survives that removal on purpose: it is the mechanism the
 * claim's background job drives, and its claim-before-send ordering is what
 * makes a double pay impossible.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES IN ONE PLACE. The seed must be removable without unpicking it
 * from a dozen files — the same property `features/alerts` and
 * `features/fiat-rails` have, and for the same reason: a subsidy is exactly the
 * kind of thing a business turns off.
 *
 * REMOVAL RECIPE — keep this true:
 *   1. delete this directory;
 *   2. delete `src/routes/v1/wallet/gas-seed/` (autoloaded, so the folder IS
 *      the registration for both endpoints);
 *   3. delete the three registry lines: the `'gas-seed'` payload in
 *      `plugins/queue/payloads.ts`, its processor in `workers/processors.ts`,
 *      and its `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` entry in `plugins/workers.ts` — that last
 *      one is not optional, the map is `Record<JobName, number>` and omitting
 *      it fails the type check;
 *   4. delete the `GAS_SEED_SUPPORT` import in `db/seed/rows.ts` and let the
 *      gas columns seed NULL;
 *   5. delete the seed's ALERT — `features/alerts/kinds/gas-seed-low-balance.ts`,
 *      `kinds/gas-seed-balance-reader.ts`, `monitors/gas-seed-balance.ts`, the
 *      `channels/slack/kinds/gas-seed-low-balance.ts` copy and their registry
 *      entries, plus that monitor's own FOUR queue lines for
 *      `'gas-seed-balance-check'` — the payload, the WORKER_CONCURRENCY entry,
 *      the processor, and (unlike the claim queue, which is event-driven) a
 *      REPEATABLES entry, because the monitor is scheduled. Miss the last one
 *      and `test/unit/worker-schedule.test.ts` fails, which is the point of it.
 *      It lives under features/alerts rather than
 *      here ON PURPOSE, so the dependency between the two features runs ONE
 *      way: alerts reads this barrel (from ONE file,
 *      `features/alerts/kinds/gas-seed-balance-reader.ts`, which is the whole
 *      of the seam), and nothing here reads alerts. The other arrangement
 *      closes the loop and costs both features their recipe — the price is
 *      this line;
 *   6. optionally delete `packages/shared/src/db/schema/gas-seed.ts` (both
 *      tables live there, and only there) plus the two gas columns on `chains`,
 *      in a generated migration. NOT required — an unread table costs nothing,
 *      and the grant history is worth keeping even after the feature stops.
 * Nothing else knows this feature exists. Three things deliberately stay behind
 * because they are NOT part of it: `chains/evm/hot-wallet.ts` (the relayer uses
 * the same clients), `resolvePrimaryWalletAddress`'s deterministic ordering
 * (a fix to shared auth code, good on its own merits, and six modules depend on
 * it), and the session client stamp on the auth token (a generic session fact —
 * see shared constants/session.ts — not a seed hook).
 *
 * IMPORT THIS BARREL FROM `src/`, not the files behind it — reaching past it is
 * what turns a removable feature back into a clustered one, and it is `src/`
 * that the removal recipe has to survive. Tests may address a module directly
 * to reach an internal the barrel does not publish (the sender constructors and
 * their port, for instance); the source-scan guard in
 * test/unit/gas-seed-module-boundary.test.ts therefore asserts the rule over
 * `src/` only.

 * chain's recorded `gas_seed_wallet_address`, because checking history against
 * the currently configured key flags every grant an older key paid. Nothing in
