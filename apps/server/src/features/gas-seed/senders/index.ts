/**
 * WHICH namespaces can pay a native gas seed, and how — the one place that
 * knows a seed on Solana is a SystemProgram transfer and a seed on EVM is a
 * value transfer.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The dispatcher (../dispatch) has always claimed that "adding a future
 * chain is a DB row + env var, no code change". That was true only inside a
 * namespace that already had a sender, and until #53a only Solana did: two
 * separate places hardcoded `namespace === 'solana'` — the deps builder (now
 * ../trigger, then in lib/onboarding-deps) and the funder-address resolution in
 * db/seed/rows. Both
 * now ask here, so a third namespace is ONE entry in this record and nothing
 * else, and the two can no longer disagree about which chains are seedable.
 *
 * Keyed by NAMESPACE, like SECRET_SCHEMA, because that is genuinely what
 * varies: every EVM chain seeds the same way. The SENDERS built from it are
 * keyed by CHAIN — see buildGasSeedSenders.
