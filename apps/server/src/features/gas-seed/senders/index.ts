/**
 * WHICH namespaces can pay a native gas seed, and how — the one place that
 * knows a seed on Solana is a SystemProgram transfer and a seed on EVM is a
 * value transfer.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The dispatcher (../dispatch) has always claimed that "adding a future
 * chain is a DB row + env var, no code change". That was true only inside a
 * namespace that already had a sender, and until #53a only Solana did: two
 * separate places hardcoded `namespace === 'solana'` — the deps builder (now
 * ../trigger, then in lib/onboarding-deps) and the funder-address resolution in
 * db/seed/rows. Both
 * now ask here, so a third namespace is ONE entry in this record and nothing
 * else, and the two can no longer disagree about which chains are seedable.
 *
 * Keyed by NAMESPACE, like SECRET_SCHEMA, because that is genuinely what
 * varies: every EVM chain seeds the same way. The SENDERS built from it are
 * keyed by CHAIN — see buildGasSeedSenders.

 *    the cast to viem's hex type at this boundary safe — the same cast
 *    plugins/chains.ts makes for the relayer key one layer up.
 *  - solana declares it as `kind: 'str'`, which only asks for a non-empty
 *    value. A malformed Solana key therefore DOES reach here and throws when
 *    `Keypair.fromSecretKey` decodes it.
 *
 * That asymmetry is why `fireRetroactiveGasSeed` builds its deps inside the
 * promise chain: construction can throw, and a throw on the caller's stack
 * would turn a completed wallet link into a 500. Tightening the Solana kind is
 * tracked with #53b; it is a behaviour change on a live deployment path, not a
