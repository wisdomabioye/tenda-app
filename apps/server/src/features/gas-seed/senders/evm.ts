/**
 * EVM GasSeedSender (#53a, reworked at #58): transfers the one-time native seed
 * from the hot wallet (`CHAIN_<ID>_GAS_SEED_KEY`) to a newly linked wallet.
 *
 * A leaf beside its Solana twin: the claim jobs orchestrate through the
 * `GasSeedSender` interface and never touch viem, so the seed can be removed
 * without the chain adapters noticing.
 *
 * WHAT #58 CHANGED, and why this file got simpler rather than more clever. It
 * used to broadcast and wait for the receipt inside ONE call, so a wait that
 * timed out — viem gives up after 180s — had to be interpreted, and every
 * interpretation was wrong somewhere: reading it as failure released a slot
 * whose money had already left and paid the user twice, reading it as success
 * stranded one who was never paid. There is nothing to interpret now. Signing,
 * broadcasting and confirming are three separate steps with the transaction's
 * hash written to the database between the first and the second, and a
 * confirmation that has not happened yet is simply `pending`.
 *
 * THE EVM-SPECIFIC RULE, stated here because its Solana twin has the opposite
 * one: an EVM transaction is pinned at a nonce and NEVER EXPIRES. It can sit in
 * mempools and be mined minutes or hours later. So "no receipt" means NOT YET,
 * never NEVER, however long it has been — `submitted_at` is deliberately unused
 * below. Only a receipt that says `reverted` is evidence of failure.
 *
 * Concurrency: two seeds racing on one hot wallet can collide on a nonce, and
 * the loser's broadcast is refused by the node. That throw is the RIGHT outcome
 * — the claim job releases the slot on a failure to broadcast, so the user is
 * seeded by the next attempt rather than recorded as seeded with nothing.
