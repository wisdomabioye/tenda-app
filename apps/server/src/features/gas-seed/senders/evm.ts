/**
 * EVM GasSeedSender (#53a): transfers the one-time native seed from the hot
 * wallet (`CHAIN_<ID>_GAS_SEED_KEY`) to a newly linked wallet.
 *
 * A leaf beside its Solana twin: ../dispatch orchestrates through the
 * `GasSeedSender` interface and never touches viem, so the seed can be removed
 * without the chain adapters noticing.
 *
 * IT WAITS FOR THE RECEIPT, and that is the whole design difference from a
 * naive port of the Solana sender. `sendAndConfirmTransaction` confirms;
 * viem's `sendTransaction` resolves the moment the node accepts the tx. A
 * sender that returned there would stamp a REAL-looking tx_ref for a transfer
 * that may never land — and `gas_grants`' (user_id, chain_id) primary key
 * makes that permanent: the user is recorded as seeded, cannot be seeded
 * again, and never received anything.
 *
 * Concurrency: two seeds racing on one hot wallet can collide on a nonce, and
 * the loser's broadcast is refused by the node. That throw is the RIGHT
 * outcome — `dispatchGasSeeds` releases the claimed slot on it, so the user is
 * seeded by the next link or verify rather than recorded as seeded and left
 * with nothing. Serialising here would buy only latency.
