/**
 * Solana GasSeedSender (reworked at #58): transfers the one-time SOL seed from
 * the hot wallet (`CHAIN_<ID>_GAS_SEED_KEY`) to a newly linked wallet.
 *
 * A leaf beside its EVM twin: the claim jobs orchestrate through the
 * `GasSeedSender` interface and never touch web3.js, so the seed can be removed
 * without the chain adapters noticing.
 *
 * TWO BUGS DIED HERE, and they were opposite halves of one mistake — trying to
 * learn a transfer's fate from whether a synchronous confirmation call threw.
 *
 *   Measured on devnet: `sendAndConfirmTransaction` confirms over a WebSocket
 *   signature subscription, and where the provider's HTTP key does not authorise
 *   WS, confirmation degrades to blockhash-expiry polling and threw ~20s AFTER
 *   the transfer had landed. The caller read that as "it did not happen",
 *   released the claimed slot, and the paid user could claim again.
 *
 *   The mirror image, and the subtler one: web3's confirmation RESOLVES for a
 *   transaction that landed and FAILED. The resolved value carries the error and
 *   the old code discarded it, so a transfer that moved no lamports was stamped
 *   delivered — and `gas_grants`' (user_id, chain_id) key made that permanent.
 *   The user could never be seeded again, having received nothing.
 *
 * Neither is reachable now. Nothing here confirms anything; `checkStatus` reads
 * the signature's status and reports what the cluster actually says, and the
 * failed case is on the MAIN path rather than a fallback nobody consults.
 *
 * THE SOLANA-SPECIFIC RULE, and it is the opposite of the EVM leaf's: a Solana
 * transaction is signed against a blockhash and PROVABLY cannot land once that
 * blockhash expires. So "the cluster has no record" is temporary at first and
 * definitive later, which is why `checkStatus` is given the moment of broadcast.
