/**
 * Operational alerts — the public face of the feature.
 *
 * Consumers import from `@server/features/alerts` and get the contracts plus
 * the registry lookups. Concrete channels are deliberately NOT re-exported:
 * they are reached only through the registry, which is what keeps plugging one
 * in or pulling one out a single-line change (see ./registry).
 *
 * Listed by name rather than `export *`, which the older barrels in this repo
 * use, because this module is mostly TYPES. The split below is the useful part:
 * `export type` says "erased at compile time", `export` says "a real value at
 * runtime", so the surface states which of these names reach the emitted
 * JavaScript at all. `export *` says nothing, and emits an `__exportStar` loop
 * that walks each module's properties at import time to relocate the handful
 * that are real.
 *
 * (Deliberately no counts here — an earlier version of this comment named
 * them, and was wrong within three commits.)
 *
 * The cost is that a contract added to ./types must be added here too. That
 * drift is loud, not silent: a consumer importing a name the barrel does not
 * re-export fails to compile, at the import.
