/**
 * The repeatable that watches every gas-seed hot wallet (#53b item 4).
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. The seed pays real money out of a wallet nobody topped up
 * automatically, and nothing anywhere read its balance outside a one-off verify
 * script. The first signal that a wallet had run dry was a user's claim
 * failing — the single moment it is too late to be useful, because the person
 * it fails for is a first-time user with no gas, which is precisely who the
 * seed exists for.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES UNDER features/alerts RATHER THAN features/gas-seed. The
 * dependency runs one way and has to keep running one way: alerts already reads
 * gas-seed (through the barrel, for the balance reader), so gas-seed must not
 * read alerts back. Deleting the seed then means deleting its alert kind, named
 * in both removal recipes; deleting alerts leaves the seed untouched. The other
 * arrangement — a monitor inside gas-seed enqueueing an alert — closes the loop
 * and costs both features their recipe.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS, for the reason enqueue-alert does not: one unreachable chain
 * must not cost the other chains their check, and a repeatable that throws
 * burns its attempts and then goes quiet, which turns a monitoring gap into a
 * silent monitoring gap.
