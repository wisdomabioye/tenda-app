/**
 * The channel registry — the ONE list of where alerts can go.
 *
 * This file is the whole plug-in seam. Adding a channel is one implementation
 * file plus one line in `ALERT_CHANNELS`; removing one is deleting both, with
 * nothing else in the codebase naming it. Nothing outside this module imports a
 * concrete channel, so no consumer has to change either way.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a `channels/index.ts` barrel re-exporting the same set: a
 * second list is a second thing to keep in step, and the failure mode is a
 * channel that looks registered from one file and isn't from the other.
 *
 * An ARRAY rather than a `Record<AlertChannelName, …>`, which is the shape that
 * would also force every declared name to be live. The record buys that at the
 * cost of a second spelling of each channel's name — the key and `channel.name`
 * — which can disagree, and a channel that logs itself as one name while
 * registered under another is untraceable in production. The array has exactly
 * one spelling, so that class of bug cannot occur; the coverage the record
 * would have given is asserted at runtime instead (see the tests), where it
 * reads as the question it actually is: "is there a channel nobody registered?"
