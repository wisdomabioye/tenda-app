/**
 * The Slack alert channel — an `AlertChannel` over lib/slack's generic
 * transport.
 *
 * The split is the point: lib/slack knows how to post to a webhook and nothing
 * about disputes, this file knows about alerts and nothing about HTTP. So the
 * transport stays reusable by anything else that wants Slack, and swapping this
 * channel out is deleting this folder and one line of ../../registry.
 *
 * WHERE an alert lands is a per-kind fact, read from ./copy — disputes go to
 * the mediation room, gas-seed balances to the operators'. This file never
 * names a destination itself; the room and the wording are declared together in
 * one map, so neither this file nor the registry has to be touched to add a
 * kind that goes somewhere new.
 *
 * Nothing outside the registry imports this module, which is what keeps
 * "unplug Slack" a one-line change rather than a search.
 *
 * The two failure postures the contract demands, both honoured below:
 *   configured() — never throws. Slack is OPTIONAL; dev and self-hosted
 *                  deployments run without a webhook and must not see errors.
 *   deliver()    — throws on failure, so BullMQ retries. A swallowed 503 is
 *                  permanent silence, the one thing an alert path may not do.
 *
 * DELIVERY IS AT-LEAST-ONCE, and that is a choice rather than an oversight. The
 * job id de-duplicates at ENQUEUE (one job per tx_ref per channel while it is in
 * Redis), but a retry re-runs this function, so a worker that posts and then
 * dies before acking posts again on the redelivery. An incoming webhook has no
 * idempotency key to prevent it. A duplicate line in a Slack channel costs an
 * operator a second glance; suppressing it would mean recording "sent" before
 * the send, which loses the alert outright whenever that record outlives a
 * failure. Note the asymmetry with the in-app channel (#13), which CAN be
 * exactly-once because a notification row has a stable id to conflict on — the
 * two differ because their sinks differ, not because one was overlooked.
