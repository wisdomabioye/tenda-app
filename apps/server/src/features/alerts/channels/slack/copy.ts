/**
 * The per-kind copy map — which alert kinds Slack can speak about, and how.
 *
 * Split from ./index for the same reason workers/escrow-fanout/copy.ts is split
 * from its fan-out: composing a message is pure, so the wording can be pinned by
 * a unit test with no database, no webhook and no queue. `index.ts` keeps the
 * side effects — reading env, loading names, posting. The wording itself lives
 * one file per kind under ./kinds, mirroring features/alerts/kinds/; ./blocks
 * holds what every kind composes with.
 *
 * This map is also what the channel's `kinds` is DERIVED from, so "this channel
 * accepts the kind" and "this channel has copy for the kind" are ONE fact rather
 * than two lists that can disagree. `AlertChannel.kinds` asks for exactly that:
 * "the channel is what knows whether it has copy for a kind".
