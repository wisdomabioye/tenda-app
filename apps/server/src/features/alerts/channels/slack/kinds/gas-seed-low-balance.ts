/**
 * What Slack says when a gas-seed hot wallet is running low (#53b item 4).
 *
 * Slack, and not the in-app bell: this is an OPERATIONS fact. Nobody triaging a
 * dispute can act on a drained hot wallet — the remedy needs the funding key —
 * and putting it in the admin bell would file it next to work items and bury a
 * funding problem behind them.
 *
 * WHICH Slack room, stated rather than implied: the channel has exactly one
 * destination, `disputes`, so this lands in the MEDIATION team's room. That is
 * the same objection one step removed, and it is a compromise rather than a
 * design — the room is watched, which beats nowhere, and giving this kind its
 * own `ops` destination means a per-kind destination on the copy map plus a
 * `configured()` that can no longer answer channel-wide. Tracked separately.
 * Until then the runbook says what it means for an operator: whoever holds the
 * funding key has to be in that room.
 *
 * The sentence an operator acts on is "N grants left", not a wei figure. Both
 * are shown — the count leads, the exact balance follows for whoever is topping
 * the wallet up.
