/**
 * Stamping a transaction with WHO SENT IT — the encode half of the feature.
 *
 * ERC-8021 attribution puts a short suffix at the end of a transaction's
 * calldata. It changes nothing about what the transaction DOES — the suffix
 * sits past every ABI-encoded argument, so the contract's decoder never reads
 * it — and what it buys is that the transaction is attributable to Tenda on
 * Celo's public dashboard.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS: one code encodes to 35 bytes, two to 51. The gas is MEASURED
 * as an `eth_estimateGas` delta, tagged vs untagged, 2026-09-05 — Celo mainnet
 * +552 / +809, Celo Sepolia +552 / +808, 0G mainnet +556 / +816.
 *
 * Byte arithmetic at EIP-2028 rates (34 non-zero x 16 + 1 zero x 4) predicts
 * 548 / 804, so the real charge runs a little above the calldata arithmetic and
 * varies by chain. Quote the measured figure: an earlier version of this
 * docblock printed the computed one and called it "measured", which is the
 * failure mode this file keeps warning about elsewhere.
 *
 * "THE DECODER NEVER READS IT" IS MEASURED TOO. `eth_call` against the live
 * TendaEscrow (0G mainnet 0x9d0193f7…, 2026-09-05), tagged vs untagged, byte
 * for byte:
 *   - `approvalWindowSeconds()` -> 0x…02a300 both ways (zero-arg dispatch);
 *   - `relayers(address)`, `escrows(bytes16)`, `getEscrow(bytes16)` -> identical
 *     both ways (one-arg, so the ABI decoder ran on real arguments);
 *   - `reclaimAbandoned/acceptEscrow/approveCompletion(bytes16)` -> both revert
 *     `EscrowNotFound()` (0xf1d80ab1), which is the BUSINESS error: the
 *     dispatcher decoded the argument and reached the lookup. A decode or
 *     fallback failure would have produced a different selector.
 * Those last three are state-changing, so `eth_call` on them is exactly what
 * `relayer.simulate` sends — this is the simulation, not an analogy for one.
 *
 * KEYED BY FAMILY, NOT BY CHAIN ID. Attribution is a property of a NETWORK
 * FAMILY's ecosystem programme, not of one deployment: Celo mainnet and Celo
 * Sepolia share a scheme and a code, and a future Celo network would too. So
 * `SCHEMES` is keyed by the manifest's own `family`, and a new Celo network is
 * one manifest entry with zero edits here — the same property the chain
 * manifest already guarantees for RPC and contract addresses.
 *
 * A CHAIN WITH NO SCHEME IS NORMAL, NOT AN ERROR. Solana, Base and 0G run no
 * attribution programme, so `tagCalldata` returns their calldata untouched and
 * says nothing about it. This is the shape an unknown chain also takes, which
 * is what makes the feature safe to leave attached while chains come and go.

 *
 * IT APPENDS UNCONDITIONALLY, including to empty calldata, and that is safe
 * here rather than safe in general: appending to `'0x'` would turn a bare value
 * transfer into a data-carrying transaction, which a contract recipient could
 * see as a fallback call. No such path exists on Celo — both Celo chains are
 * `gasPolicy: 'feeCurrency'`, so they run no native gas-seed transfer, and every
 * other Celo transaction the server builds is an ABI-encoded contract call.
 * `assertAttributionCodes` passes `'0x'` on purpose and throws the result away.
 *
 * IT THROWS on a malformed code, and that is deliberate. `toDataSuffix` rejects
 * anything outside `[a-z0-9_]`, longer than 32 bytes, or over 255 bytes joined.
 * Swallowing that would ship transactions that look fine and are permanently
 * uncounted — the tag lives in calldata, so it cannot be added after the fact
