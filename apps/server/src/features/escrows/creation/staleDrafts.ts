 * Abandoned drafts: the retention sweep's selection.

 * reconcile act on funded escrows and pending attempts. This discards the ones
 * that have outlived `DRAFT_RETENTION_DAYS`, and ONLY the ones the demo ring and
 * the discard route could also discard — still a draft, and no create awaiting
 * confirmation (`./discardDrafts` holds those guards and re-asserts them inside
 * the DELETE). `gig_details` and the other satellites go with the row through
 * their `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
