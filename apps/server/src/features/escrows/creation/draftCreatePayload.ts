/**
 * A draft row → the adapter's createEscrow payload. ONE mapping for the three
 * places that build a create from a persisted draft — POST /v1/escrows (the
 * replayed or freshly inserted row), build-create and the relayed-funding
 * routes (via prepareDraftCreate) — so the fields a transaction encodes can
 * never drift from the row that records them.
 *
 * Acceptance mode and the unassign window come from the DRAFT ROW, not from
 * config: the row is what that draft was created with, and today's config is
 * not a substitute (see the escrows column comments).
