/**
 * The DEMO agent session (#108) — a bearer minted with no wallet proof.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Ten reviewers read the agent contract on 2026-09-05 and all
 * ten stopped at the same place: `POST /v1/agent/tasks` answers 401 to a
 * stranger, so nobody reached the 402 terms the document describes. Registering
 * properly needs a wallet signature, which a reviewer running a language model
 * does not have. This is the door: one shared, rate-limited agent account that
 * anybody can hold a token for.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It is not a second implementation of the flow —
 * that was the earlier "anonymous 402" idea, abandoned on measurement: terms
 * are built FOR a specific wallet and a specific draft (`payment.creator`, a
 * nonce over the whole params, EIP-712 over both), and the relay refuses to
 * emit terms that would not hash to the token's live domain separator. With no
 * user there is no creator, so an anonymous quote would have to INVENT one and
 * hand out terms nobody can sign — drift built into the API, and worse than an
 * honest 401. A demo ACCOUNT has no drift by construction: it is the same code
 * path, with a real account on the end of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO, and why that needs no extra machinery:
 *   - It cannot spend. Terms are built for `AGENT_DEMO_ADDRESS`; funding needs
 *     an EIP-3009 signature from the key behind that address, which the server
 *     does not hold and never asks for.
 *   - Nothing it posts reaches the public feed. A task is a DRAFT until a
 *     confirmed on-chain create moves it to `open`, and `publicGigConditions`
 *     requires `open`. No funding, no publication — that is the existing rule,
 *     not a special case added here.
 *   - It cannot lock itself out. The pending-gig cap counts gigs a worker has
 *     ACCEPTED or SUBMITTED and excludes drafts outright, so a shared account
 *     accumulating demo drafts never starts refusing the next reviewer.
