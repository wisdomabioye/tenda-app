/**
 * Escrow-event push/WS fan-out. MOVED here out of workers/processors.ts — not
 * copied — to keep that file under the size budget and to unit-test the copy in
 * isolation. Nothing of it remains there: processors.ts builds the deps and
 * calls `fanOutEscrowEvent`, and this module owns the description of what it
 * does, so there is one place to update when a step is added.
 *
 * verify-tx republish (stage-2 § listener step 5) calls fanOutEscrowEvent. Its
 * steps, numbered as they are in the body — this list had drifted to three
 * entries while the body had five, which is the failure the paragraph above
 * promises not to have:
 *   1. WS: an `escrow:<id>` frame the TransactionMonitor subscribes to (#42).
 *   2. Alerts: an operational alert for the events an OPERATOR must act on.
 *   3. On `escrow.created`, hand the new-gig subscriber expansion to the
 *      'fanout-subscribers' queue and return. Enqueued, never expanded here —
 *      the expansion is unbounded and this runs on a scarce verify-tx slot.
 *   4. Applicants the transition moved without them acting (assign settles
 *      rivals, unassign revives them), from ids the applier returned.
 *   5. Push: a 'notifications' job to the party who must LEARN of the event
 *      (the non-actor), resolved from the escrow row.
 *
 * Steps 2 and 5 have different audiences and are deliberately independent:
 * features/alerts reaches whoever holds a permission (a mediator), this
 * module's own copy reaches the parties to the escrow. Neither is the other's
 * fallback, and neither may cost the other its delivery.
 *
 * Split into ./copy (the kind-aware wording matrix), ./subscribers (the
 * new-gig SQL fan-out, now driven by its own queue rather than by step 3) and
 * ./enqueue-notice (the single delivery loop), with the orchestrator here.
 * Barrel keeps the `@server/workers/escrow-fanout` import surface stable.

  //
  //    Placed here, above every early return below, because which events raise
  //    an alert is `ALERT_REF_BY_EVENT`'s decision and not this function's
  //    routing. Hooked further down, `escrow.created` would be unalertable (it
  //    returns at step 3) and so would every event with no party copy (step 5
  //    returns when `partyNoticeFor` is null) — a future alert kind would land
  //    on one of those and go silently undelivered.
  //
  //    Deliberately NOT wrapped in try/catch: `enqueueAlert` never throws (G5,
  //    documented at features/alerts/enqueue-alert.ts), so a catch here would
  //    be dead code that reads as a live guarantee. The direction that matters
  //    is the other one — the party notices below must not be lost because an
  //    operator's alert failed — and that is what G5 buys.
  //
  //    Awaited rather than fired and forgotten, and NOT because of an unhandled
  //    rejection — G5 means there is none. Because this runs inside a BullMQ
  //    job: a floating promise lets the job be reported complete while the
  //    alert is still in flight to Redis, so a deploy or a crash in that window
  //    loses it with nothing left to retry. `no-floating-promises` needs
  //    type-aware linting, which this package does not enable yet, so the guard
  //    is a test (test/integration/alerts-fanout.test.ts).

  //    unbounded in the subscriber count, so doing it here held one of those
  //    slots for its full duration and queued transaction verification behind a
  //    popular gig. Enqueueing is one round trip regardless of how many
  //    subscribers there turn out to be.
  //
  //    No `job_id`: a dedup key would be pointless and harmful here. Pointless
  //    because the caller already dedups — verify-tx republishes only when the
  //    transition APPLIED, and its step-1 `isProcessed` check means a retried
  //    job returns before republishing. Harmful because BullMQ keeps a failed
  //    job under its id (removeOnFail: 7 days), so a keyed expansion that
  //    exhausted its retries would silently swallow a later re-enqueue.

  //    place either decision reaches them. Runs before the notice lookup

  //    The two lists are disjoint by construction (one event settles, the
  //    other revives), so nobody receives both for one transition.
  //
  //    The ids come from the applier rather than a fresh query on purpose:
