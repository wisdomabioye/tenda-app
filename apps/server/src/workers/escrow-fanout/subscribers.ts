/**
 * New-gig fan-out: when the on-chain create confirms (escrow → open), notify
 * the gig_subscriptions whose city/category match.
 *
 * Runs on its OWN queue ('fanout-subscribers'), not inline in the verify-tx
 * republish — see the payload note in plugins/queue.ts for why. What that buys
 * beyond the freed slot: this work now gets BullMQ's retry posture. Inline, a
 * failure part-way through was swallowed by verify-tx's best-effort republish
 * catch — whoever had already been enqueued kept their notice and everyone
 * after the failure point silently never heard about the gig, with nothing left
 * to retry. As a job it is retried, which is what the stable ids below are for.
 *
 * The matching is SQL, not application code, which is why it is covered by an
 * integration test rather than a fake store — a stub would assert the query we
 * wrote, not the rows postgres returns.
