 * is checked by calling it directly instead. A field silently dropped in

  // down, a dead Slack webhook, an RPC rejecting everything — a week's worth
  // accumulates with no ceiling. `notifications` is where that bites: one
  // popular gig fans out to one job per subscriber, so a 50,000-subscriber gig
  // that exhausts its attempts leaves 50,000 failed job hashes in Redis from a
  // SINGLE post. Precisely when memory pressure is least welcome.
  //
  // 5,000, matching removeOnComplete because the two want the same thing (a
  // bounded finished set) and one number needs one justification: the failures
  // that pile up in an outage are all the same failure, so the 5,000th adds
  // nothing to the 50th. What is retained is for inspecting payloads and
  // re-driving, not for noticing — BullMQ emits `failed` on every attempt (the
  // worker awaits moveToFailed, which itself decides retry-or-terminal via
  // shouldRetryJob), so the handler in plugins/workers.ts has already logged
  // every one of them: `worker: job failed` at warn, or the info line for a
  // RetryableError the reconcile repeatable takes over.
  //
  // Per queue, not app-wide: BullMQ trims the queue's own `failed` zset, so the
  // real ceiling is 5,000 × the number of JobNames.
  //
  // Honest cost: count evicts OLDEST first (ZREVRANGE keeps the newest —
  // measured: 10 failures under a cap of 3 retained jobs 8, 9, 10), so an
  // outage past 5,000 loses its onset, usually the most diagnostic failure.

 * above out of reach of the queues that tick forever. plugins/workers.ts
 * builds a Queue per repeatable to register its scheduler and passed
 * `{ connection }` alone — so every tick those schedulers produced carried NO
 * retention at all (BullMQ merges the registering queue's `defaultJobOptions`
 * into the scheduler template, and undefined there means keep forever).
 * Measured against real Redis: with a bare `{ connection }`, nothing was ever
 * trimmed — waiting on 8 scheduler-produced completions left 11 completed
 * hashes behind (the scheduler kept firing while the probe settled) and every
 * job carried `opts.removeOnComplete: undefined`. The same probe with these
 * options held at the cap. REPEATABLES runs three schedulers every 60s and two
 * every 5min, so that is ~4,900 completed job hashes a day, accumulating for
 * the life of the deployment. Not a bigger number than the uncapped
 * `removeOnFail` this task set out to close — an outage can out-produce it in
 * minutes — but a worse shape: that one needed something to go wrong and
 * stopped when it was fixed, this one ran on a healthy system and never
 * stopped. Sitting one file away from the constant meant to bound it.
 *
 * Guarded by a source scan in test/unit/queue.test.ts rather than by review: a
 * bare `new Queue(name, { connection })` compiles, runs, and passes every
 * behavioural test, because nothing about it is wrong except what Redis keeps.
