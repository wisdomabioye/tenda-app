 * needs a new background job, ./index.ts only when the producer surface itself
 * changes. It is also the only part of the module a reader adding a
 * queue needs, and it was the block that pushed the single file past its
 * budget.

 * compiler, so nothing here reaches runtime and no importer of `plugins/queue`
 * pays for it. The `AlertJob` import below depends on that.
