/**
 * BullMQ + Redis queue plugin — the typed producer surface. Workers and their
 * concurrency live in plugins/workers.ts, processors in workers/processors.ts;
 * both key off `JobName` from here, so this module decides what queues exist.
 *
 * Without `REDIS_URL` the plugin degrades to a stub whose `enqueue` throws
 * `INTERNAL_ERROR` (501), so call sites fail loud instead of silently dropping
 * jobs. Callers that treat enqueueing as best-effort (webhooks log + continue,
 * reconcile covers the gap) already handle that.
 *
 * Adding a new queue: add ONE entry to `JobPayload` (./payloads). `JobName`
 * derives from it, so the name, the worker concurrency map and the processor
 * map all fail to compile until they account for it. TypeScript exhaustiveness
 * ensures callers can't enqueue an unknown queue.
 *
 * Was one 411-line file. Split at the seams the sections already drew —
 * ./payloads is what the queues carry, ./connection where they live,
 * ./options how their jobs behave, and this file the plugin that puts the
 * three together. The `@server/plugins/queue` import path is unchanged for
 * every consumer, which is why this barrel exists at all.
 *
 * Named re-exports, not `export *`, matching features/alerts/types: `export
 * type` marks what is erased and `export` what survives to runtime, and no
 * `__exportStar` loop is emitted. The erasure is load-bearing here — see the
 * cycle note in ./payloads.
