/**
 * In-process BullMQ workers + repeatable schedules (#33; stage-0 open
 * question resolved: in-process is fine until volume justifies a separate
 * worker deployment, at which point this plugin moves verbatim into its
 * own entrypoint).
 *
 * Gated on REDIS_URL: without it nothing starts and the API behaves
 * exactly as pre-#33 (queue 501s, reconciliation absent, client-ping +
 * lazy expiry carry the load).
 *
 * Retry posture: a handler throws RetryableError while a transaction awaits
 * confirmation, and BullMQ retries on the queue's exponential backoff. What
 * happens once attempts exhaust is PER QUEUE, which is why the failure log
 * below does not name a specific rescuer:
 *   - `verify-tx` is picked up by the reconcile repeatable (its 5-min scan
 *     re-enqueues anything the chain eventually confirms and times out the rest
 *     at 30min, stage-2 § reconciliation);
 *   - `gas-seed-confirm` has no repeatable and needs none — it resolves itself
 *     by marking the grant `unresolved` once it is older than the shared
 *     give-up window, well before its attempts run out.

  // unserialised because signups arrive spread out; claims do not.
