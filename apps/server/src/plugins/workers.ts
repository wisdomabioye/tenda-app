/**
 * In-process BullMQ workers + repeatable schedules (#33; stage-0 open
 * question resolved: in-process is fine until volume justifies a separate
 * worker deployment, at which point this plugin moves verbatim into its
 * own entrypoint).
 *
 * Gated on REDIS_URL: without it nothing starts and the API behaves
 * exactly as pre-#33 (queue 501s, reconciliation absent, client-ping +
 * lazy expiry carry the load).
 *
 * Retry posture: verify-tx throws RetryableError while a tx awaits
 * confirmation, BullMQ retries on the queue's exponential backoff; once
 * attempts exhaust, the reconcile repeatable owns the attempt (its 5-min
 * scan re-enqueues anything the chain eventually confirms and times out
 * the rest at 30min, stage-2 § reconciliation).
