/**
 * Did that transaction actually carry our attribution tag?
 *
 *   pnpm --filter tenda-server verify:celo-tag <tx hash> [chain id]
 *
 * The check Celo's own instructions insist on, and the reason it is a script
 * rather than a test: the tag lives in signed calldata, so it cannot be added
 * after the fact and there is no backfill. Everything sent before the wiring is
 * right is permanently uncounted — which makes "decode transaction #1" the
 * cheapest check in the project and the most expensive one to skip.
 *
 * Defaults to Celo mainnet because that is the chain that scores; pass a
 * manifest chain id to check the testnet wiring first. RPC comes from .env when
 * configured and falls back to the manifest's public endpoint, so this runs
 * against a fresh checkout with no secrets at all.
 *
 * Exit status is the answer: 0 = every configured code is on-chain, 1 = not.
