/**
 * A durable record of what a run actually posted.
 *
 * Every successful post funds an escrow on a real chain, and the only handle
 * for cancelling one later is its escrow id. Terminal scrollback is not a
 * record: a run can be cut short by the rate limiter (one preview run was), the
 * window can be closed, the output can scroll away — and the money is still
 * committed. So each receipt is appended the moment its 201 lands, BEFORE the
 * next gig is attempted, which means a run that dies halfway still leaves an
 * exact record of everything it funded.
 *
 * JSONL rather than a JSON array: appending a line cannot corrupt the lines
 * already written, whereas rewriting an array can lose the whole file if the
 * process dies mid-write. A partial last line is one lost receipt; a truncated
 * array is all of them.
