 * behind the amounts, lives in /home/abioye/tenda/task.md.
 *
 * TYPED, NOT JSON, and that is the point: `GigSeed` is derived from
 * `AgentTaskBody`, so an invalid category, an unknown proof type, or a
 * `structured` requirement without its params is a COMPILE error rather than a
 * 422 discovered one gig into a live run.
 *
 * THE PARAM RULE the compiler cannot express, so it is stated here: `proof_params`
 * is required if and only if `proof_requirements` contains `geotag` or
 * `structured`, and refused otherwise (see `parseProofParams`). A geotag radius
 * is measured against the gig's own latitude/longitude, so every geotag listing
 * below carries coordinates.
 *
 * AMOUNTS are the PREVIEW values — deliberately varied to exercise arithmetic
 * rather than volume, including one that forces the fee's floor division. The
 * mainnet run overrides them all with `--amount`.

      'Collect a sealed envelope from the pickup point named in the gig and hand it to the named recipient at an address on the same street. Both points are within walking distance — if you find they are not, do not accept, and tell us. Photograph the handover: the envelope with the recipient\'s door, desk, or a signed receipt. Do not open the envelope. If the recipient is not there, do not leave it with anyone else — return it to the pickup point and report that; you will still be paid.',
