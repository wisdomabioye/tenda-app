/**
 * The book a run posts: the built-in one, or a JSON file a reviewer signed off.
 *
 * A JSON book gives up the compile-time check the typed book has, so it gets
 * the server's OWN checks instead, run offline before anything is funded: the
 * same `validateCreateEscrow` and `validateGigDetails` the one-shot route
 * calls, over the body the run would send. What posts is REBUILT from their
 * validated outputs, so no value that has not passed the server's rules can
 * reach the wire — and a bad entry fails at load, naming its index and the
 * server's own message, instead of as a 422 one gig into a funded run.
 *
 * KEYS ARE CLOSED against the agent document's `AgentTaskBody`, the schema
 * the drift test proves the live route accepts. The route itself ignores keys
 * it does not know, so a typo'd `proof_requirement` would otherwise post a gig
 * with no requirement at all. The three per-run keys are refused rather than
 * overridden: a file that names a chain is the wrong workflow, not a default.
