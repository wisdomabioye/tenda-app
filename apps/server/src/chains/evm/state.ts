/**
 * On-chain reads the adapter needs BEFORE it can build a transaction: the
 * escrow tuple decode, and the per-action address/asset resolution built on it.
 *
 * Lifted out of the `evmAdapter` closure so the two are reachable and readable
 * on their own — they were the only parts of a 410-line factory that did no
 * building at all. The closure over `args`/`rpc` becomes an explicit
 * `EvmAdapterContext` parameter, which is the whole behavioural difference:
 * same code, dependencies now stated rather than captured.
 *
 * `EvmAdapterArgs` below is an `import type` from ./index, which ./index also
 * imports from — a cycle on paper that TypeScript erases, so nothing circular
 * reaches the runtime. Keep it type-only: turning it into a value import would
 * make it real. `EvmAdapterArgs` stays declared in ./index because that is the
 * adapter's public surface (`@server/chains/evm`).
