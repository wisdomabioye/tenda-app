/**
 * Where a chain's escrow address comes from, and the boot check that stops the
 * DB copy of it from going stale.
 *
 * There are two consumers of that address with different reach: the server's
 * own adapters read it from env (`chains/secrets.ts`), while mobile has to be
 * TOLD it — it builds and signs transactions locally and cannot see `.env`, so
 * the value travels over `/v1/platform/chains`.
 *
 * It used to travel via `chains.escrow_program`, a column written only by
 * `db:seed`. Env is re-read every boot; the column is re-written only when
 * somebody remembers to re-seed — and a redeploy feels like an env change, not
 * a schema change. So the column drifted, silently and by two contract
 * generations on both EVM testnets (2026-07-27): the server kept working
 * because it never reads the column, while mobile was handed dead addresses.
 *
 * The route now serves from the loader, which removes that failure mode. The
 * column still exists (the seed writes it, and it is worth having on the row a
 * mediator or an operator reads), so `assertChainRegistryInSync` is what keeps
 * the two honest.

 * database unstartable; it also cannot be acted on, since `escrows.chain_id`
 * is a foreign key and creation on that chain fails loudly at the first insert

 * A mismatch is different, and the reason is NOT that these values are served
 * — since 2026-07-27 they are not, the route reads the adapter. It is that
 * `db:seed` writes `chains` and `assets` in one run, so a chains row that
 * disagrees with config is evidence the seed has not run since the deploy that
 * changed it — which puts the ASSETS rows in doubt, and `assets.token_address`
 * IS served and IS what the mobile balance reader and the approve/permit flows
 * spend against. The cheap, verifiable column stands in for the expensive,
