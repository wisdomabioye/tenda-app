/**
 * Consolidated Fastify type augmentations.
 *
 * Lives here (not inside individual plugin files) so module-augmentation
 * order doesn't depend on the order ts-node compiles plugins at runtime.
 * Before this file existed, `src/plugins/audit.ts` was failing typecheck
 * with `Property 'db' does not exist on FastifyInstance` because audit.ts
 * compiles before db.ts in some lazy paths and TS couldn't see the
 * augmentation declared inside db.ts.
 *
 * All Fastify decorators added by plugins should be declared here. Plugins
 * still IMPLEMENT the decorators; this file just types them.
