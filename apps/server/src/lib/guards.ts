/**
 * Fastify preHandler that 404s a malformed `:id` before it reaches the driver.
 *
 * Every id column in the schema is postgres `uuid`, which rejects malformed
 * input with `invalid input syntax for type uuid`. Unguarded that surfaces as
 * a 500 — the caller is told the server fell over when their id was simply not
 * an id. 404 rather than 400 matches the unknown-id answer these routes
 * already give, and the precedent in gigs/_id/applications.
 *
 * Registered as a plugin-level hook rather than per route, because the failure
 * mode is a handler FORGETTING the guard: one registration covers every `:id`
 * route in the scope, including ones added later. Register it inside the
 * plugin, never on the parent router, so the authenticate hook still runs
 * first and a stranger gets 401 rather than a 404. *
 * `code` defaults to NOT_FOUND but takes the route's own vocabulary where it
 * has one (USER_NOT_FOUND), so a malformed id answers exactly as an unknown
 * one does rather than inventing a second shape for the same outcome.
 *
 * `param` defaults to 'id'. It exists because /v1/admin/standing/:user_id
 * names its param differently, and a guard hard-coded to `id` would sit on
 * that route doing nothing at all — worse than being absent, because the
 * registration reads as if it were covered.
