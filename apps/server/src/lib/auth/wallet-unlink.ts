/**
 * Unlink a wallet from a user, atomically. Extracted from the route so the
 * concurrency contract is testable at the DB layer (the route is a thin
 * input-validating wrapper).
 *
 * The whole load → guard → delete runs inside ONE transaction holding a
 * per-user advisory lock, so two concurrent unlinks of DIFFERENT wallets can't
 * each read "2 credentials remain" and both delete, stranding an account with
 * no sign-in method left (TOCTOU). Mirrors the orchestrator's per-email lock.
 *
 * Guards (throw AppError, rolling the tx back):
 *   1. target must be linked to the user (404 NOT_FOUND).
 *   2. never the user's ONLY wallet (409 LAST_WALLET) — a wallet is required to
 *      transact, so the account must always keep at least one (stricter than the
 *      identities∪wallets last-credential rule, which a verified email satisfies).
 *   3. not the primary while another wallet remains (409 WALLET_IN_USE).
 *   4. not a party to an active escrow on its namespace (409 WALLET_IN_USE).
