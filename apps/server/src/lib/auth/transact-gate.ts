 * The wallet the tx builders resolve for a user on a namespace — primary
 * first, deterministic. ONE definition shared by the chain adapters'

 * will bake (`escrows.assigned_counterparty_address`): two copies of this
 * query is how the recorded wallet and the baked wallet would drift apart.
 * Null when the user has no wallet on the namespace.
 *
 * FULLY ORDERED, and it was not (#53c-1). `is_primary DESC` alone leaves ties
 * unbroken, and ties are the COMMON case rather than an exotic one: the partial
 * unique index allows one primary per USER across every namespace, so a user
 * whose primary is a Solana wallet has NO primary on eip155 at all. With two
 * EVM wallets linked, the row this returned was whatever Postgres happened to
 * scan first — free to differ between two calls, which is how the wallet an
 * escrow RECORDS and the wallet its transaction BAKES come apart, and how a gas
 * seed funds a wallet the user never signs with (the grant's (user_id,
 * chain_id) key then makes that the only seed they ever get).
 *
 * The tiebreak is FIRST LINKED, then address: the oldest verified wallet on the
 * chain is the one a returning user is most likely to still hold, and the
 * address is a total order that settles the remaining tie of two wallets
 * verified in the same transaction — a millisecond timestamp is not unique
 * enough to be a sort key on its own.
 *
 * `verified_at` is NOT NULL (it defaults to now() on link), so no row sorts
 * ahead of the others by being null.
