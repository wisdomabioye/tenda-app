/**
 * Shared projections for the exchange read surface (cutover §3): one column
 * map + one serializer so /v1/exchange and /v1/exchange/:id return the same
 * summary FIELDS, in the same shapes, from one place.
 *
 * "Byte-identical", which this said until #175, is no longer the claim and must
 * not be restored: `creator` is deliberately viewer-dependent now — a settled
 * party reads the legal name and the face, everyone else reads the abbreviation
 * — so the two surfaces differ on exactly that field, by design. Every other
 * field still comes from here precisely so it cannot drift.
 *
 * The creator is projected through `ExchangePartyRef`, NOT `UserRef` (#175). An
 * exchange row pairs whoever posted it with the money they are moving and a
 * clock, and a full legal name and face beside that is a targeting list — the
 * approach P2P fraud actually uses mid-window. `UserRef` is unchanged and still
 * serves `/v1/gigs`, where publishing the poster IS the product.
 *
 * The SELECT is still `USER_COLS` — the same columns, one source, no second
 * list to keep in step. The name and avatar are INPUTS here rather than wire
 * fields: nothing reaches a caller except through `toExchangePartyRef`, which
 * names every field it copies, so a column added to `USER_COLS` later cannot
 * appear on an exchange row by inheritance.

 * so the other side's identity is not theirs to read yet. The list surface
 * passes false unconditionally, because an OPEN offer has no settled party.
 *
 * `full_name` is `formatFullName`'s answer, so a party with no profile name
 * reads as `''` rather than `'null null'` — and `null` when withheld, which is
 * what tells a client "not yours to see" apart from "this person has no name".
