/**
 * RECORDED examples, attached inline to the Agent API document (#109).
 *
 * WHY THEY EXIST. Ten reviewers read this contract on 2026-09-05 and all ten
 * reported the same thing: they never called the endpoint, and the document
 * showed them no payload to reason about. It contained zero `example` keys —
 * measured, not estimated. That was the single most-repeated complaint in the
 * round, ahead of length.
 *
 * WHY THEY ARE RECORDED AND NOT WRITTEN. A hand-written sample is a second
 * implementation of the wire, and it begins drifting from the first the day it
 * is committed — which is the failure this whole document exists to avoid. The
 * values in ./recorded-exchange came out of one real exchange driven through
 * the real route against a real node, and
 * test/integration/agent-x402-recording.anvil.test.ts re-drives that exchange
 * on every run and fails when the shape no longer matches. The examples cannot
 * quietly rot; they can only fail loudly.
 *
 * WHY INLINE AND NEVER `$ref`. A reader whose fetch stops early must meet the
 * payload beside the endpoint, not in a tail it never reaches. They used to go
 * only in the agent-only subset, the canonical document being kept for humans
 * and codegen; the subset is retired (#135, 2026-09-08) and the one document
 * carries them.
 *
 * WHAT THE VALUES ARE. A real EIP-3009 authorization over a real ERC-20's own
 * domain separator, a nonce the escrow contract itself computed, and a
 * transaction the relayer really broadcast — captured on a local node that
 * presents itself as eip155:84532.
 *
 * TWO OF THE PUBLISHED VALUES ARE THE HARNESS'S, and they are named here rather
 * than left for a reader to trip over. The ADDRESSES are that node's, so they
 * are not Base Sepolia contracts anyone can look up. And `created.enqueued` is
 * FALSE, which is the degraded answer, not the normal one: the recorder runs
 * with no Redis (test/helpers/test-app/env.ts deletes REDIS_URL), so the
 * verify-tx enqueue throws and `recordTxAttempt` reports it — a deployment with
 * a queue answers true. Either way the attempt is durably recorded and the task
 * is verified, which is what the field's own description in the document now
 * says. Everything else — every shape, and every value the server derived
 * rather than the harness chose — is what production sends.
