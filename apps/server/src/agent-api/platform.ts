/**
 * The one PLATFORM path the agent document carries: `GET /v1/platform/chains`,
 * the deployment's own answer to "which chains can I settle on here" (#126).
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE. `chain_id` used to be documented as an enum of every
 * `CHAIN_MANIFEST` entry, which offered agents `solana:mainnet` and
 * `eip155:8453` — both `status: 'planned'`, refused by every deployment that
 * exists. The manifest is the set of chains this CODEBASE knows; the set a
 * deployment settles on comes from its `CHAIN_<id>_*` secrets, and the two are
 * different facts. The document is a module-load constant and can only state
 * the first, so ./scalars now checks the SHAPE of a chain id and points here
 * for the list — and a pointer to an endpoint the document does not describe
 * is the same dead end the enum was, one indirection further out.
 *
 * The route already answers with exactly the right set: enabled in the
 * database INTERSECTED with the adapter registry, so a chain the server cannot
 * build or verify a transaction on is omitted rather than advertised. Nothing
 * about that behaviour is added here; it is only made visible to a reader who
 * never leaves this document.
 *
 * ONE FILE, not the `paths-x` / `schemas-x` pair the two older surfaces use.
 * Those pairs split a SURFACE in half — v0 reads across ./paths + ./schemas, v1
 * writes across ./paths-agent + ./schemas-agent — and each half carries enough
 * to stand alone. This surface is one path and three schemas; splitting it the
 * same way would buy symmetry at the cost of two files neither of which can be
 * read on its own.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE ADDRESS SOURCE. `escrow_address` is the contract the agent's
 * own signature authorises as spender — served from the registry the server
 * itself uses, never from the stored column, which is written by `db:seed` and
 * has drifted two contract generations behind before now.
