/**
 * GET /v1/admin/users — what the FILTERS actually select (#110).
 *
 * The refusals on this route (an unassignable role, a status outside the pair)
 * were closed by #105 T5a; what nothing exercised was the filters doing their
 * job. A filter that matches the wrong column, or a subquery that has lost its
 * correlation, answers 200 with a plausible-looking list — the failure mode is
 * a wrong answer, not an error, which is why refusal coverage cannot reach it.
 *
 * THE WALLET SEARCH IS THE ONE TO WATCH. It is an `exists(...)` over
 * user_wallets correlated on `user_wallets.user_id = users.id`; drop the
 * correlation and the subquery still returns rows for every user, so the search
 * would answer "everyone" for any address that exists at all. Both halves are
 * asserted below: the matching user IS returned, and the other user is NOT.
