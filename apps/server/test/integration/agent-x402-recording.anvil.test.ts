/**
 * The RECORDER and the GUARD for #109's published examples.
 *
 * Ten reviewers read the agent contract on 2026-09-05 and all ten said the
 * same thing: they never called it, and the document showed them no payload.
 * It contained zero `example` keys — past tense, because this suite is what
 * fixed that. And it is a RECORDING rather than a hand-written sample for one
 * reason: a sample is a second implementation of the wire, and it starts
 * drifting the day it is written. Everything published in
 * `src/agent-api/examples.ts` came out of an actual exchange this file drove,
 * and every run re-drives it and compares.
 *
 * WHY ANVIL AND NOT THE ORDINARY HARNESS. The fake eip155 relay answers
 * `quote` with empty EIP-712 `types` and a zero nonce. That is correct for
 * asserting route behaviour — the other agent suites want a constant — and it
 * would be a lie as a published example, because `payment.typed_data` is the
 * one part of the 402 an agent has to sign. Here the REAL adapter runs against
 * a real node holding the real escrow contract and a real EIP-3009 token, so
 * the terms carry the token's own domain separator, populated types, and a
 * nonce the contract agrees with. The chain id anvil presents is
 * `eip155:84532`, the same one the harness seeds — but the TOKEN and ESCROW
 * addresses are anvil's deterministic deployments, not Base Sepolia's, and the
 * published operation says so (#133): a reader who signed the example's
 * verifyingContract would be signing for a contract that does not exist.
 *
 * TO RE-RECORD after a deliberate wire change: `pnpm record:x402`.
