/**
 * What a DEMO bearer may reach (#177).
 *
 * The demo session hands a token to anyone who asks — no body, no proof, no
 * account. Until the scope claim that token was an ORDINARY one, and MEASURED on
 * production 2026-09-14 it read `GET /v1/exchange`: three live offers, each
 * pairing a real person's name, avatar and country with the money they were
 * moving, to a caller who had proved nothing.
 *
 * THE EXAMPLE ROUTE MOVED, and the reason is worth reading before changing it
 * back. These cases used the exchange book as their stand-in for "a gated
 * route". #179 made that book ANONYMOUS, so `authenticate` no longer runs on it
 * and the scope check never fires — a demo bearer now reads it exactly as a
 * caller with no token does, which is correct: there is no authority left to
 * withhold. Refusing a public document to a valid token would be worse than
 * anonymous. So the gated example is now `GET /v1/gigs?mine=`, whose handler
 * calls `fastify.authenticate` MID-HANDLER — which also keeps proving that the
 * scope check rides along there and not merely on preHandlers.
 *
 * These cases pin the two halves that make the fix worth having:
 *   - the demo still does everything the document offers it (the 402, and the
 *     draft read-back that follows), so scoping costs the feature nothing;
 *   - the refusal discriminates by SCOPE, not by agent-ness — a REAL agent from
 *     /v1/agent/register is unrestricted. Without that case a blanket "agents
 *     cannot read" bug would pass this file.
 *
 * `../helpers/agent-demo-env` first, for its side effect: config memoises on
 * first read, so the demo address must be set before the harness builds an app.
