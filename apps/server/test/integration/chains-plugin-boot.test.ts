/**
 * The chains plugin AS IT BOOTS (open_issues #89).
 *
 * This file exists because of a real escape. Every piece of the contract-pinning
 * fix was correct and unit-tested, and the plugin still built its adapters
 * without the contract registry — so in production every adapter knew only its
 * current contract and the fix did nothing. The unit tests could not see it:
 * each constructed its own adapter and passed the set itself.
 *
 * So nothing here constructs an adapter. It registers the REAL plugin against
 * the REAL database, lets it read the REAL secrets loader, and then asks the
 * decorated registry to verify a receipt emitted by a SUPERSEDED contract — a
 * question that can only be answered correctly if every hand-off along the boot
 * path actually happened.
