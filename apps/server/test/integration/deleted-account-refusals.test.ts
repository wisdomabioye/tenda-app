/**
 * What each surface answers for an account that NO LONGER EXISTS (#105 T4, #108).
 *
 * Split out of auth-refusals.test.ts when that file passed 300 lines, and it is
 * the better home anyway: these cases share one mechanism and one setup, and
 * three of them exist only because of it.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM. `authenticate` loads the user row and answers 401 'User no
 * longer exists' when it is gone — which is why a naive probe (create, delete,
 * request) never reaches anything further, and why the handlers' own guards read
 * as unreachable. IT CACHES: status and role are kept for STATUS_CACHE_TTL_MS
 * and the DB read is skipped on a hit. So a user who has made ONE authenticated
 * request and is then deleted passes `authenticate` from cache for the rest of
 * the minute, and whatever reads the database NEXT is the first to notice. That
 * is not exotic — an account deleted or hard-purged by an admin while its
 * session is live hits it on the very next request.
 *
 * So every case here is a claim about ORDER AND STATE, and one probe samples one
 * state. The last case runs BOTH, because it is the one where the answer changes
 * with the state rather than merely arriving from a different line.
 *
 * COLD, all four routes give the same answer, because it is the same preHandler
 * answering: 401 'User no longer exists'. WARM is where they diverge, and that
 * is what each case below asserts:
 *   users/me          401 'user no longer exists'   (the handler's own copy)
 *   PATCH users/me    401 'user no longer exists'   (from UPDATE … RETURNING)
 *   auth/me           404 'user not found'
 *   POST /v1/escrows  403 PROFILE_INCOMPLETE        (a second preHandler)
 * The first two differ from the cold answer only in capitalisation, so every
 * assertion pins the message rather than the status. The last case runs BOTH
 * arms, because there the answer changes rather than merely moving.
