/**
 * An `unassign` must undo the whole assignment cycle, not just the status.
 *
 * `assign_accept` writes state in THREE places — the escrow row, the winner's
 * application, and every rival's — and only the first was being rewound. Every
 * symptom that produced is asserted here, because none of them is visible from
 * the escrow's status alone:
 *
 *   - the released worker kept reading "You got this gig — it's yours to
 *     deliver" above an Apply button, because their row was still `assigned`;
 *   - the poster kept seeing "your worker said they are not available" against
 *     the NEXT worker, because `assignment_released_at` was never cleared;
 *   - that stale stamp also dropped the gig out of the new worker's active-gig
 *     cap and suppressed their abandonment strike for the life of the escrow.
 *
 * Real DB via the app's own store; gated on TEST_DATABASE_URL.
