/**
 * The refusals that guard a DRAFT escrow between creation and publication
 * (#112 — the four the #105 sweep left unclosed).
 *
 * A draft is the staging row for an escrow whose transaction the creator has
 * not signed yet, or has signed and not yet had confirmed. That window is
 * re-enterable on purpose: a client retries `POST /v1/escrows` with the same
 * `creation_operation_id` and must get the SAME draft back, never a second
 * escrow. These guard the ways that can go wrong.
 *
 * CLOSED HERE:
 *   escrows/index:119  a create transaction is already awaiting confirmation.
 *   escrows/index:197  a concurrent request won the operation key with
 *                      DIFFERENT terms.
 * RECORDED, with the measurement, at the end of this file:
 *   escrows/index:194  the winner of that race cannot be found afterwards.
 *   escrows/_id:77     the draft left `draft` between the SELECT and the DELETE.
 *
 * WHY THE 197 CASE STAGES ITS RACE RATHER THAN RACING TWO REQUESTS. The
 * SEQUENTIAL path refuses reused-with-different-terms at line 137 with the same
 * status, the same code and a byte-identical message, so a 409 out of two
 * concurrent requests cannot say which of the two answered — and a scheduling
 * change would move the case off the guard it is named for while it kept
 * passing. T2 wrote exactly that test, watched it survive the removal of 197,
 * deleted it, and recorded both lines in escrows-create.test.ts as unstageable.
 * That last part is what this file disproves: the hook below puts the competing
 * row in at the one instant the branch exists for, deterministically.

/**
 * NOT COVERED, recorded with what was measured rather than asserted:
 *
 *   escrows/index.ts:194  'Could not reconcile escrow creation' — the arm where
 *   the race winner cannot be found after our insert lost to it. The branch
 *   around it is reachable, and is now executed deterministically by the 197
 *   case above (and less deterministically by 'concurrent creation retries
 *   converge on one draft' in create-contract-body.test.ts, which reaches it
 *   with two live requests). This arm is not: the lookup at 187 uses EXACTLY the
 *   predicate that made the insert conflict, so the row it looks for is the row
 *   that just refused us. It can only be missing if a third actor deleted it in
 *   the two statements between — that actor exists (DELETE /v1/escrows/:id,
 *   creator-only, drafts-only), which is why the guard belongs here, but landing
 *   a delete inside a window with no seam is something a test can make likely
 *   and not certain. MEASURED: zero hits in the full-suite lcov, and changing
 *   what the line answers leaves this file and create-contract-body green.
 *
 *   escrows/_id/index.ts:77  'Escrow left draft state, it may have just been
 *   published' — the same shape one route over. The DELETE re-checks
 *   `status = 'draft'` in its WHERE, so a create confirming between the SELECT
 *   at :47 and the DELETE at :72 destroys nothing and answers this instead. A
 *   status change visible BEFORE the delete is refused earlier, at :51, with a
 *   different message, so reaching :77 means the change landing INSIDE the
 *   request, between two adjacent statements whose only gap is a driver
 *   round-trip. MEASURED: zero hits in the full-suite lcov; changing what it
 *   answers leaves escrows-lifecycle.test.ts (which drives the rest of that
 *   route) and this file green; and what a caller actually gets instead was run
 *   — a second sequential DELETE is 404 'escrow … not found' from
 *   `loadEscrowOr404`, a published one is the 409 at :51.
 *
 * Both are compare-and-swap guards whose failure mode is benign by design: they
 * can only fire when the row moved, and what they do about it is refuse. They
 * stay, and this note is what a future reader gets instead of a flaky test.
