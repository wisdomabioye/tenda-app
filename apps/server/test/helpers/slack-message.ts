/**
 * Reading a `SlackMessage` — the four questions every Slack copy suite asks.
 *
 * Extracted when alerts-slack-copy.test.ts was split (task #45): three files
 * now assert against the same message shape, and a fourth
 * (alerts-slack-gas-seed-copy.test.ts) had already hand-rolled a
 * character-for-character copy of the first three functions. Four copies of
 * "what does this message actually say" is four chances for one of them to
 * quietly stop looking at the context block.
 *
 * Deliberately READ-ONLY and assertion-free: these turn a message into
 * strings, and the suites decide what is true of them. A helper that asserted
 * would put the interesting half of each test somewhere the test does not
 * mention.
