/**
 * The alert fixtures the three Slack copy suites share (task #45).

 * alerts-slack-copy.test.ts was 522 lines and split into channel / copy /
 * safety files. All three render the same dispute alert against the same
 * names and the same environment, and three copies of "what a typical dispute
 * alert looks like" is three chances for one of them to drift into testing a
 * shape the resolver never produces.
 *
 * The ids are MODULE-level constants rather than fresh per call: assertions
 * here name the party they expect ("Ada Lovelace"), which only works if the id
 * and the name stay paired across every suite that imports this.
