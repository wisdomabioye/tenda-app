/**
 * The ONE validator configuration the Agent API suites share.
 *
 * Every option the closed-schema drift guarantee rests on, set EXPLICITLY:
 *
 *  - `strict` — a schema a strict validator refuses is a document defect, not
 *    a validator setting to relax.
 *  - `coerceTypes: false` and `removeAdditional: false` — these are ajv's
 *    defaults today, and the guarantee is exactly that a live body with a new
 *    field, or a string where a number belongs, FAILS. Left implicit they were
 *    a default an ajv major could change under the suites without a line of
 *    this repo moving; written down they are a decision.
 *  - `allErrors` — report every violation, so a failure names the whole gap
 *    rather than the first field of it.
 *  - `validateFormats: false` — `format` is documentary in this document (see
 *    SchemaObject.format in @tenda/api-doc); validating it here would fail
 *    bodies the contract never promised to constrain.
 *
 * Set here rather than per suite, where one copy could quietly loosen.
