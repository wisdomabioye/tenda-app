/**
 * Configures a demo address for the agent demo-session suite — a SIDE-EFFECT
 * module, so **import it first**.
 *
 * `getConfig()` memoises on its first read and the harness reads config while
 * building the app, so the variable has to be set before any import that
 * touches config. A plain assignment at the top of the suite would NOT do it:
 * imports are hoisted above statements, which is the same trap `oauth-env.ts`
 * exists for and documents.
 *
 * The unconfigured case cannot live in the same file for the same reason — once
 * config is loaded it is fixed for the process — so it has its own suite.
