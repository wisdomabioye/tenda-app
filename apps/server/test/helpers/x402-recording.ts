/**

 * field the server added, renamed or dropped) and the STABLE VALUES (a scheme
 * name, an error string, a status). Both are checked. What cannot be checked
 * is anything that is different by design on every run — a fresh uuid, a
 * deadline computed from now, a signature over a random key — and those are
 * named one by one in `VOLATILE` rather than skipped by a loose match, so a
 * field that becomes unstable has to be added here deliberately.
