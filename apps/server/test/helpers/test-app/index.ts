/**
 * HTTP integration harness (CO2): a real Fastify app — real db/auth/queue
 * plugins, real autoloaded routes, the production error envelope — with
 * ONE substitution: a fake chain registry, so no test ever depends on
 * devnet RPC.
 *
 * The barrel every suite imports as `helpers/test-app`. It was a single
 * 511-line module until #44 split it along the seams below; the import path
 * is unchanged, so no suite needed editing.
 *
 *   env.ts         process.env stubs + TEST_DB_CONFIGURED
 *   fake-chain.ts  the fake registry, its adapters and their sentinels
 *   app.ts         boot, suite lock, resetDb, seeding, platform config
 *   rows.ts        DB-backed row builders + authHeader
 *
 * `./env` is imported FIRST and for its side effects, so the stubs are applied
 * before anything below is evaluated. Each sibling imports it too, so entering
 * through a submodule rather than this barrel still gets stubbed env — which
 * matters for `fake-chain.ts`, the one module that reads process.env at module
 * init (see env.ts for the measurement).
