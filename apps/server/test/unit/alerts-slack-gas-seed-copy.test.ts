/**
 * What Slack SAYS when a gas-seed hot wallet runs low (#53b item 4).
 *
 * Its own file rather than another block in alerts-slack-copy.test.ts, which is
 * already well past the 300-line ceiling and is about the dispute copy.
 *
 * The copy is the whole product here. Everything upstream — the tick, the
 * balance read, the dedup — exists to put one sentence in front of an operator,
 * and the ways that sentence fails are all silent: a wei figure nobody converts
 * into a decision, a chain named by an id that throws on the way to being
 * pretty-printed, a "1 grants left" that reads as a bug and gets ignored.
