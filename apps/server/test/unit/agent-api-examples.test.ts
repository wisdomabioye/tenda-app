/**
 * The published examples (#109): are they there, are they INLINE, and are they
 * still true?
 *
 * The recording's freshness is the anvil recorder's job — it re-drives the
 * exchange and compares. This suite owns everything that can be checked about
 * the STATIC artefact, and it runs with no node and no database, so the
 * properties a reader depends on are never gated behind a toolchain:
 *
 *   - each example validates against the very schema it sits beside, using the
 *     same strict ajv the drift suite holds live responses to;
 *   - the typed data is signable rather than the fake relay's hollow shell;
 *   - nothing is published by `$ref`, which a truncated reader could not follow.
