/**
 * The CONFIRM job (features/gas-seed/claim/confirm) — #58.
 *
 * This is where a transfer's fate is decided, and the only place allowed to
 * decide it. Its predecessor made the same decision inside a `send()` call by
 * interpreting whether a wait had timed out, which is not evidence of anything;
 * two production money bugs came out of that reading.
 *
 * THE DISCIPLINE, and every test here is a face of it: `pending` is not
 * `failed`. A chain that has not answered gets asked again. Only an answer — a
 * reverted receipt, a signature carrying an error — frees a claimed slot, and
 * only a positive answer stamps one.
