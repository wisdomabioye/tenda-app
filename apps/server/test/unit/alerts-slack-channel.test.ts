/**
 * features/alerts/channels/slack — the CHANNEL's declared shape.
 *
 * Which kinds it accepts, which room each one goes to, whether it reports
 * itself configured, and which names it asks the delivery path to load. Split
 * from the copy itself (task #45), because these are questions about the
 * channel's contract with the registry, while the copy files are about what an
 * operator ends up reading:
 *
 *   this file                    — the contract: kinds, routing, configured(),
 *                                  partyIds
 *   alerts-slack-copy.test.ts    — what a dispute alert SAYS
 *   alerts-slack-safety.test.ts  — what user text cannot do to it
 *
 * WHY THE CONTRACT IS WORTH A FILE: `kinds` and the copy map have to be ONE
 * fact. A channel that advertises a kind it cannot render passes
 * `deliverAlert`'s opt-in check and then delivers nothing — a dispute that
 * looks handled and isn't. Asserting `kinds` against the full `ALERT_KINDS`
 * vocabulary rather than a list written here is what makes a new kind force a
 * decision instead of silently reaching nobody.
 *
 * `testChannelContract` is invoked HERE and nowhere else. It registers tests at
 * module load, so a second call in a sibling file would run the whole contract
 * twice and make a failure report two files.
 *
 * A unit test: the copy is pure by construction (names arrive as a Map), so
 * nothing here needs postgres, Redis or a webhook. `deliver()` itself is
 * covered in test/integration/alerts-slack.test.ts, where the name lookup is a
 * real query.
