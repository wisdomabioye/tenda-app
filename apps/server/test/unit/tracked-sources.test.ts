/**
 * No source file is gitignored.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. `.gitignore` carried `profile-*` (0x) and
 * `profile*` (clinic) with no leading slash, and a gitignore pattern without a
 * slash matches a path SEGMENT AT ANY DEPTH — so both quietly swallowed
 * test/integration/profile-completeness.test.ts. The file existed, its ten
 * tests passed locally, `npm test` was green, and it would simply never have
 * been committed. The fix that file guards would have shipped with nothing
 * checking it, and the first sign would have been a coverage drop nobody
 * connected to it.
 *
 * Nothing else looks: the compiler reads the working tree, so does the test
 * runner, and `git status` stays quiet BY DESIGN for ignored paths. Only asking
 * git directly finds it.
 *
 * SCOPE, measured rather than assumed: `git check-ignore` does not report files
 * that are already TRACKED — ignore rules only govern untracked paths. Adding
 * `notify*` to .gitignore and asking about the tracked src/lib/notify.ts got
 * "not ignored" (exit 1); the same pattern against an untracked sibling
 * reported the match. That is the right scope rather than a gap: a pattern
 * covering a tracked file is harmless, because git goes on tracking it. The
 * damage is only ever to files not yet added — which is exactly the case that
 * bit. Do not "improve" this to flag tracked files too; it would fire on
 * nothing that can actually go wrong.
 *
 * Cheap to keep honest — one `git check-ignore` call for the whole tree.
