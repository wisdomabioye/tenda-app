/**
 * The harness's substitution seam (#109): `realEvmRegistry`, and the
 * `fakeRegistry(substitute)` underneath it.
 *
 * It exists so the x402 recorder can put the REAL eip155 adapter in front of a
 * real anvil node while every other harness behaviour stays fake. Its only
 * caller is an anvil-gated integration suite, so without these cases the seam
 * is unexercised on any machine without the foundry toolchain.
 *
 * The property that must not break is one a COMMENT in fake-chain.ts currently
 * carries alone: the Solana adapter stays FIRST, because `reconcile-escrows`
 * falls back to `list()[0]` and the listeners plugin picks the first Solana
 * adapter. A substitution written as delete-then-set, or keyed on the wrong
 * chain, moves it — and every suite that depends on the order would fail
 * somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * Imported from `./fake-chain` rather than the barrel on purpose: `fakeRegistry`
 * is deliberately not re-exported (no suite builds its own registry), and the
 * module under test is the one place that may reach past that.
