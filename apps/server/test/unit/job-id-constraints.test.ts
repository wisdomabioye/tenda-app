/**
 * Every BullMQ jobId this app produces must be one BullMQ will accept.
 *
 * Three modules mint keyed job ids, none of them aware of the others:
 * `dedupKey` (core/queue/idempotency), `verifyTxDedupKey` (jobs/verify-tx) and
 * `alertJobId` (features/alerts/identity). Each documents the constraint in
 * prose, and prose drifts — src/jobs/verify-tx.ts stated it flatly wrong
 * ("BullMQ rejects a jobId containing ':'") in two places until #33. This file
 * states the rule ONCE, executably, and runs every producer through it.
 *
 * What it catches that nothing else does: the failure is invisible in CI.
 * `Job.validateOptions` runs inside `queue.add`, so an invalid id throws only
 * against a live Redis — which CI does not have — and the queue double the
 * other suites use accepts anything. A fourth component added to `dedupKey`, or
 * the ':' strip dropped from `verifyTxDedupKey`, would pass every existing test
 * and then throw in production on the first enqueue.
