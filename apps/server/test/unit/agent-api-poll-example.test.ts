/**
 * The POLL example (#97) — the step the published flow used to stop short of.
 *
 * Split from agent-api-examples.test.ts when that file passed 300 lines, the
 * way config-env-blank.test.ts was split from config-env.test.ts. The subjects
 * are genuinely different: that file owns the task POST's three payloads, this
 * one owns the gig read they end on.
 *
 * Why it exists at all: all ten round-one reviewers named "the response from
 * polling GET /v1/gigs/{task_id}" as missing evidence. The recorder had been
 * fetching it and throwing it away.
