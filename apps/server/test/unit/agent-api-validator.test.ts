/**
 * The shared validator behaves the way the drift guarantee assumes.
 *
 * `agent-api-drift.test.ts` validates LIVE bodies against the document's closed
 * schemas, and everything it proves rests on three ajv options in
 * test/helpers/agent-api-validator.ts. Those options had no test of their own:
 * flipping `removeAdditional` to 'all', `coerceTypes` to true, or `strict` off
 * left every unit suite green — measured — because the only thing exercising
 * them needs a database.
 *
 * So the guarantee is stated here, cheaply, in terms of what must FAIL. A
 * validator that quietly strips an undocumented field or coerces a string into
 * a number would let exactly the drift the document exists to prevent through,
 * and the integration suite would keep reporting success.
