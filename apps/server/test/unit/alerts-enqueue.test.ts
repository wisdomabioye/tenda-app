/**
 * features/alerts/enqueue-alert — the producer.
 *
 * Three things this file is actually pinning, none of which are "the function
 * runs":
 *
 *  1. WHICH escrow events raise an alert, asserted against the full event
 *     vocabulary rather than a hand-written list, so a new on-chain event forces
 *     a decision instead of defaulting to silence.
 *  2. The job id's SHAPE, because BullMQ rejects a malformed one at enqueue and
 *     the failure surfaces inside a guarded catch as a generic warn.
 *  3. That the producer NEVER THROWS and never lets one channel's failure cost
 *     another's job — the two properties the escrow fan-out depends on.
 *
 * A unit test: nothing here touches postgres or Redis.
