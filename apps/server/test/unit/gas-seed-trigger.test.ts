/**
 * `fireRetroactiveGasSeed` — the fire-and-forget contract, at the ONE place it
 * can be broken without any test noticing.
 *
 * The trigger runs on a successful wallet link and after phone verification,
 * AFTER the row it belongs to has already been written. So anything it throws
 * synchronously turns a link that succeeded into a 500 — a failure
 * `test/integration/auth-link-wallet.test.ts` measures the route against, but
 * cannot provoke, because the harness configures no seed key and the throw
 * lives in sender CONSTRUCTION.
 *
 * That construction really can throw: Solana's `GAS_SEED_KEY` is declared
 * `kind: 'str'` in SECRET_SCHEMA, so any non-empty value passes boot and only
 * `Keypair.fromSecretKey` finds out. Rotating that key to a malformed value is
 * enough — the deployment boots, and the next wallet link 500s.
