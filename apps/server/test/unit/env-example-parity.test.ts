/**
 * Machine-checks the parts of .env.example that CAN rot silently (the EVM
 * deploy runbook documented BASE_*-era names long after the loader moved to
 * CHAIN_*; prose can't be tested, but the example file can):
 *   1. every CHAIN_* key it documents is a key the secrets loader reads,
 *   2. every manifest chain has an entry, and every chain that DECLARES a
 *      native gas seed documents the key that funds it,
 *   3. every boot-required var is documented, and
 *   4. SLACK_WEBHOOK_* agrees with the destination registry IN BOTH
 *      DIRECTIONS — an undocumented destination is a channel nobody knows to
 *      configure, which is exactly how an alert path stays quiet, and
 *   5. every OPTIONAL url var is documented, for the same reason as 4 rather
 *      than the same reason as 3: a missing REQUIRED var halts the boot and
 *      names itself, so it cannot stay secret. An optional one just degrades.
 *   6. every attribution family's code var is documented — same reason as 4,
 *      and a sharper one: an operator who copies a misspelt name from here gets
 *      a deployment that sends UNTAGGED transactions, and the tag cannot be
 *      added afterwards (#83). It is outside the CHAIN_* namespace on purpose,
 *      so rule 1 does not cover it.
