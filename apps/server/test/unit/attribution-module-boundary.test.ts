/**
 * Attribution stays REMOVABLE, and its removal recipe stays TRUE — a source
 * scan, modelled on gas-seed-module-boundary.test.ts, over the two properties
 * no behavioural test can see.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A COMMENT. The barrel promises two things: that
 * one import is the whole public surface, and that deleting the directory plus
 * the call sites it lists removes the feature. Both are prose, and prose rots
 * silently — an import of `features/attribution/tag` compiles, runs and passes
 * every other test while quietly turning a one-directory delete into a hunt.
 *
 * The second test is the one that has already earned its place. The first cut
 * of #83 attached the tag at two call sites and the barrel said "both places
 * the server produces EVM calldata" — there were three, and the sweep
 * (chains/evm/sweep.ts) broadcast untagged Celo transactions. A whole-file read
 * caught it; this catches the NEXT one, at the moment a fourth call site is
 * added rather than whenever someone next reads the docblock.
 *
 * Scanning `src/` only, deliberately — the same reasoning as the gas-seed
 * guard: tests legitimately address internals the barrel does not publish, and
 * forbidding that would push modules into the public surface just to be
 * testable.
