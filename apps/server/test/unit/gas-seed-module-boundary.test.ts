/**
 * The gas seed stays REMOVABLE — a source scan, modelled on
 * alerts-registry.test.ts, over the property no behavioural test can see.
 *
 * The removal recipe in `features/gas-seed/index.ts` promises that deleting the
 * directory, one route folder and three registry lines removes the feature.
 * That promise is only true while nothing in `src/` reaches PAST the barrel: an
 * import of `features/gas-seed/claim/service` compiles, runs, passes every
 * other test, and quietly turns a one-directory delete into a hunt. Nothing
 * else would ever notice.
 *
 * Scanning `src/` only, deliberately. Tests legitimately address internals the
 * barrel does not publish (the sender constructors, the EVM port), and a rule
 * that forbade that would push those modules into the public surface just to be
 * testable — which is the opposite of what this guards.
