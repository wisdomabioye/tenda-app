/**
 * #133 — the published 402 example carries a LOCAL NODE's addresses under a
 * Base Sepolia chain id, and the document must say so where the reader meets
 * the example.
 *
 * The recording is deliberately made on anvil (see agent-x402-recording
 * .anvil.test.ts: a fake relay would publish empty EIP-712 types and a zero
 * nonce). The cost is that `asset`, `pay_to` and `verifyingContract` in the
 * example are anvil's deterministic deployments. A reader who took them for
 * Base Sepolia's would sign a domain for a contract that does not exist.
 *
 * Two halves. The label: the operation names the example as a capture on a
 * local node and sends the reader to the registry for THIS deployment's
 * addresses. The reason the label is needed: the example's addresses really
 * are not the manifest's for that chain — so if the recording is ever re-made
 * against a fork (option (b) of #133) and they start to match, this fails and
 * the label gets rewritten rather than left as a stale warning.
