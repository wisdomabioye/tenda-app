/**
 * The integration guide is IN the served document (#157 stage 3).
 *
 * The point of putting the walkthrough in `info.description` is that the JSON
 * an agent fetches and the page a docs site builds carry the same words. Two
 * ways that quietly stops being true, neither caught by anything else:
 *
 *   1. the interpolation is dropped — the document still validates, still
 *      drifts against nothing, and the guide simply is not there;
 *   2. a header, scheme or version is TYPED into the prose instead of read
 *      from the constant the API uses, so the guide keeps telling a reader to
 *      send a header the server stopped accepting.
 *
 * The paths it names are already held to the document by "every path named in
 * prose is one the document defines", and its chain/asset abstinence by "no
 * description hand-writes a chain or asset id" — both of which walk
 * `info.description` too. This file covers what those two cannot see.
