/**
 * Whether a deployment can offer a demo at all (#108) — the pure half.
 *
 * It is pure so that all three answers can be covered in one process:
 * `getConfig()` memoises on its first read, so the wire-level cases need a
 * suite each, and only the decision itself can be exercised exhaustively here.
 *
 * The MALFORMED case is the one worth having. An unset address fails at the
 * door and names itself; a typo'd one does not — the session is minted, the
 * account and wallet row are created, and the failure surfaces later, deeper,
 * and somewhere that does not mention `AGENT_DEMO_ADDRESS` at all.
