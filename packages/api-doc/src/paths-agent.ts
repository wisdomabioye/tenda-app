/**
 * Agent API v1 path items: the write surface. THREE operations, all POST,
 * spelled from the shared route map so they cannot drift from the server; the
 * drift test proves each is served and that the live 402/201 bodies validate
 * against the closed schemas in ./schemas-agent.
 *
 * Two of them take a body and mint or spend a session (#19). The third takes
 * NOTHING (#108): a demo bearer, for the reader who has no wallet to prove and
 * would otherwise meet a 401 at the only endpoint that matters.
 *
 * An operation's `description` is CommonMark — OpenAPI says so, and both
 * consumers render it as such. It is written as steps and branches rather than
 * as one paragraph, because these three descriptions carry the whole posting
 * flow and a reader who has to parse a slab of prose to find the resend rule
 * will not find it. The RESPONSE descriptions stay plain sentences on purpose:
 * they are quoted verbatim into the `message` of each sample error body, and
 * markdown there would put backticks on the wire.
