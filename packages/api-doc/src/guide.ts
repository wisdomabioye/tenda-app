/**
 * The integration guide — prose, INSIDE the document (#157 stage 3).
 *
 * An agent that has this document should not need a second page to get from a
 * wallet to a posted task. The walkthrough therefore lives in
 * `info.description`, which OpenAPI renders as CommonMark: the JSON the server
 * serves and the page a docs site builds carry the SAME words, because there
 * is only one copy of them. A guide kept anywhere else is the second
 * description of the API this package exists to prevent.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS TYPED TWICE. Every path, header, scheme and version is
 * interpolated from the constant the API itself uses, so a rename breaks the
 * build rather than the reader. And no chain or asset id appears: this
 * document is identical on every deployment, and which chains one settles on
 * is a per-deployment fact that `GET /v1/platform/chains` answers — the rule
 * the document's whole prose is held to.
