/**
 * The payout countries, keyed by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.
 *
 * Adding a market is this entry plus one spec file — every downstream surface
 * derives: SUPPORTED_PAYOUT_COUNTRIES, PAYOUT_CURRENCIES, the mobile country
 * picker, the server's field validation, and the landing's market count.
 *
 * One country maps to exactly one currency, deliberately. A country that needs
 * two (a Nigerian holding both a naira account and a domiciliary dollar one)
 * would need the currency stored on `bank_accounts` rather than inferred from
 * the country — a schema change, not a spec file.
 *
 * DISABLING A MARKET is commenting its line out here. Everything below reads
 * this object, so that one edit removes it from `SUPPORTED_PAYOUT_COUNTRIES`,
 * `PAYOUT_CURRENCIES`, the p2p provider's advertised currencies, the mobile
 * country picker, and the landing's market count. New payout accounts in that
 * country are refused, and so are new offers priced in its currency.
 *
 * Expect the tests that pin the current market list to fail when you do it.
 * That is the intended friction, not breakage: retiring a corridor should leave
 * a visible diff, so update them in the same commit. No count is given here on
 * purpose: an earlier draft of this line said "three", and adding one more test
 * in the same sitting made it seven.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT REACH, and why that is deliberate:
 *
 *   - OPEN OFFERS ALREADY IN THE BOOK stay listed and takeable. They are
 *     commitments made in good faith under the old rules, and they self-limit:
 *     each expires at its accept deadline and refunds. Auto-hiding them was
 *     considered and rejected — it would fire identically whether a market was
 *     retired for low volume or for a legal order, and in the first case it
 *     silently strands sellers who did nothing wrong. When the reason IS legal,
 *     the per-escrow takedown path is the tool: it is explicit, auditable, and
 *     scoped to the offers you actually mean.
 *   - ACCEPTED TRADES settle normally. The escrow is on-chain and the fiat leg
 *     is between the two parties; interrupting one strands money mid-flight.
 *   - SAVED ACCOUNTS in that country stay visible and stop working. The masking
 *     and `countryDisplayName` both handle an unknown country, so the row still
 *     renders — the user learns it is dead when they try to post.
 *   - The currency stays in SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES. It must: trades that already
 *     happened in it still have to format and price correctly.
 *
 * There is no runtime toggle. `fiat_providers.is_enabled` disables a PROVIDER,
 * and chains have `chains.is_enabled` in the DB, but a payout market lives in
 * this file — so disabling one is a release, not a config change.
