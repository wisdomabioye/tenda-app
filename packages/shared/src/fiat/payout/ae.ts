 * United Arab Emirates — bank transfer by IBAN (AED). No wallet rail: domestic
 * transfers here run over IBAN through the banks, and the money-transfer
 * businesses expats actually use are cash-over-counter, not an account we
 * could store and a buyer could pay into unattended.
 *
 * The IBAN carries the bank inside it, so unlike the other markets the account
 * number IS the routing information. The bank name is still collected because
 * the payer sees it before sending — a name they recognise is the difference
 * between confidence and an abandoned trade — but nothing is derived from it.
 *
 * Validation runs the real ISO 13616 mod-97 checksum, not just a length check.
 * This is the one field in the registry where a typo does not bounce: a wrong
 * IBAN either fails at the bank days later or, if the check digits happen to
 * fit, credits a different account with no way back.
