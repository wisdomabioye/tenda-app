/**
 * Brand facts — the ONLY source of product identity strings and outbound
 * links, shared by mobile, web and the landing page (which composes these
 * with its release-specific facts: version, APK url, about copy).
 *
 * Consolidated 2026-08-15 from apps/mobile/lib/app-info.ts and
 * apps/tendahq/src/content/app-info.ts, which had already drifted apart.
 * Release/distribution facts (version, apkUrl) deliberately stay in the
 * landing page's own file — scripts/check-app-version.mjs gates them there
 * against app.json.
 *
 * THREE PITCH STRINGS WITH THREE JOBS, because one string doing two jobs is
 * how they drifted the second time. By 2026-08-31 the product had NINE
 * competing pitches: a benefit tagline here, a mechanism headline on the
 * landing, and seven restatements in between. Each of the three below names
 * where it goes; none may be reused somewhere another one belongs, and no app
 * may hardcode a rival — `test/constants/pitch-strings.test.ts` enforces that.
 *
 * All three cover BOTH products (gig work and P2P cash trades) and BOTH kinds
 * of poster (people and AI agents). A pitch that names only gigs describes
 * half the product; one that names only people is now describing it wrong.

/**
 * The stalled-payment promise, in words, for a given approval window.
 *
 * A FUNCTION because the window is a CONTRACT value that differs per chain
 * (Celo mainnet 24h, the testnets 48h) and is served live as
 * `approval_window_seconds` on each `ChainRegistryEntry` (#148). A surface
 * holding the registry passes the real numbers through `guaranteeForWindows`;
 * `APP_INFO.guarantee` is the static fallback for surfaces with no registry
 * to hand, and it names NO number — a static count was how the feed hero
 * promised 48 hours on a deployment whose contract enforces 24.
 *
 * The claim is exact. `TendaEscrow.claimStalledPayment` lets the COUNTERPARTY
 * settle once `block.timestamp >= approvalDeadline`, with no poster, admin or
 * dispute involved (`POST /v1/escrows/:id/claim`). So this is not "payment
 * guaranteed" hand-waving — it is a specific right, and it was missing from
 * every brand string the product had.
