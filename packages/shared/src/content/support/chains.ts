/**
 * The chains the SUPPORT pages talk about — derived from CHAIN_MANIFEST, not
 * typed here, for the reason the landing derives its own list: this copy named
 * three chains while four were live, so 0G shipped to mainnet and every support
 * surface went on saying "Solana, Base and Celo".
 *
 * Same shape as the landing's `LANDING_CHAINS`, deliberately, so the two read
 * as one idea rather than two conventions: a small lead-list, then a stable
 * sort, and a family absent from the lead-list still appears (in manifest
 * order) instead of vanishing from the docs by being unlisted.
 *
 * The ORDER is a product decision (user, 2026-09-10): EVM leads and Celo leads
 * within it, so Solana is never the first chain a reader meets. It is expressed
 * as two rules rather than a hand-written sequence — lead families first, then
 * EVM before Solana — so a new EVM chain slots in ahead of Solana on its own.
