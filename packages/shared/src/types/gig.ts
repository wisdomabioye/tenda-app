//   - `isGigAcceptable(gig)` answered "can a worker take this?" from status and
//     `accept_deadline` alone, i.e. the PRE-Stage-10 rule. It would say yes on
//     an approval-mode gig, which is the exact mistake `canAccept` was made
//     mode-aware to stop, sitting one autocomplete away under a more inviting
//     name. Use `canAccept` (utils/gig-utils), which takes the acceptance mode
//     as a required field, with `acceptWindowState` for the deadline half.
//   - `computeCompletionDeadline` duplicated the server's helper of the same
//     name (lib/escrow/deadlines.ts) with a different signature, under a
//     docblock claiming to mirror it — a claim nothing checked.
