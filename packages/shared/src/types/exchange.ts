/**
 * Who posted an offer, as a STRANGER may see them (#175).
 *
 * Not `UserRef`. That type carries `first_name`, `last_name` and `avatar_url`,
 * and an exchange row pairs whoever posted it with the money they are moving
 * and a clock — a full legal name and a face beside that is a targeting list,
 * which is how P2P fraud actually approaches a seller. `UserRef` stays exactly
 * as it is for `/v1/gigs`, where publishing the poster IS the product and the
 * feed is deliberately indexable; the money-movement pairing is what makes
 * exchange different.
 *
 * `full_name` and `avatar_url` are null until the viewer is a SETTLED party —
 * the same line `payout_account` already sits behind on the detail route, and
 * for the same stated reason: a pending assignee has not accepted, so the
 * seller's identity is not theirs to read yet.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, so nobody reads it as more than it is: `id` is still
 * here — the profile link and the chat href are built from it — and
 * `GET /v1/users/:id` is anonymous and answers with the name and the face. So
 * this withholds the PAIRING from a feed, not the identity from a determined
 * reader: re-pairing costs one attributable request per row instead of none.
 * That is a real raise in cost and it is not a seal. `#180` holds the decision.
