/**
 * Escrow lifecycle as a SHAPE: a linear spine with a terminal branch.
 *
 * `ESCROW_STATUS_ORDER` deliberately warns against rendering itself as a
 * timeline — it interleaves one progressive path with four states that branch
 * off wherever the escrow happened to be, so drawing it in order implies
 * disputes follow completion. This module is the shape that comment asks for,
 * and it lives in shared because "which statuses are progress and which are a
 * branch" is domain truth, not a web layout detail.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as ESCROW_STATUS_SETTLEMENT, which classifies whether the
 * contract still holds value: `disputed` is unsettled AND a branch, `completed`
 * is settled AND the end of the spine. Conflating them would put a dispute on
 * the happy path.
