/**
 * The completion-window field: what the reader may pick, and what that means
 * in seconds.
 *
 * Both clients had the presets and the arithmetic inline and identically, and
 * both had the same gap — `if (n > 0) onChange(n * 86_400)` with no ceiling,
 * so 91 days produced a value the server refuses and the picker said nothing.
 * It lives here for the reason `gig-budget.ts` does: it is one rule about one
 * field, and a copy in each app is how the two drift apart.
 *
 * The bound is the PRODUCT rail (`MAX_COMPLETION_DURATION_SECONDS`, 90 days),
 * not the protocol one (`ESCROW_LIMITS.maxCompletionDurationSeconds`, 180
 * days): a picker should offer the tighter of the two.
 *
 * Be clear about what enforces it, because it is not what you would assume.
 * `POST /v1/escrows` checks only that `completion_duration_seconds` is a
 * POSITIVE INTEGER (features/escrows/creation/validateCreateEscrow.ts) — it
 * applies neither bound. So this rail is advisory: it is what the composer
 * refuses to submit, not what the API refuses to accept. Do not describe it as
 * server-enforced. The server gap is filed separately; when it closes, this
 * comment should say so rather than being quietly assumed.
