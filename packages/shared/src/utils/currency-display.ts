 *
 *   SOL      — the rate is already what we want;
 *   a STABLE — worth ~1 USD, so the USD leg divides out
 *              (NGN-per-USDC = rates.NGN / rates.USD).
 *
 * Everything else answers null, and that third arm is load-bearing rather than
 * defensive. Mobile's copy of this rule returned the SOL rate for ANY
 * non-stable, which prices an ETH amount as though a unit of ETH were a unit of
 * SOL — wrong by whatever the two are worth relative to each other, which is a
 * money error rather than a rounding one. It is not hypothetical on the display
 * side: a card renders whatever `asset` the wire carries, and `gigBudgetRails`
 * has rails for native tokens ("0.001–10,000 for a native token"). Whether the
 * composer's picker offers one today is #81's question, not answered here. No
 * number beats a wrong one either way.
 *
 * Keyed on `symbol`, not the asset id, so SOL_DEVNET prices like SOL — which is
 * also what the old `toAssetPaymentDisplay` compared, so the native path is
 * unchanged for every asset it already handled.

 * all the way out to the wire. Sixteen call sites across web and mobile used to

 * the server and none of them a read these formatters serve: the two route
 * guards that validate an incoming currency, and one rate-map lookup that
 * checks for `undefined` on the next line. Before this the formatters threw a
 * TypeError on anything unlisted — destructuring `locale` off `undefined` —
 * which is a blank screen where a price should be.
 *
 * No NEW row can carry a bad one: exactly two routes accept a fiat_currency
 * from a request body — exchange offer creation and fiat quote creation — and
 * both reject anything unlisted, with a 400 and a 422. Every other server write
 * propagates a value from those. What that does NOT cover is a row written
 * before those guards existed, and it lives two services away from the casts
 * that read it, so a third write path would not know about it. Hence the belt.
