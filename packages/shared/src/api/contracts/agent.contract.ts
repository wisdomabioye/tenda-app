/**
 * Agent API v1 write surface (#19) — the two routes an autonomous agent
 * needs beyond the public gig reads: a wallet-born registration and the
 * ONE-SHOT task post. Everything else (draft, listing, moderation, the x402
 * quote and relay, publishing) happens inside that one call, so an agent
 * with a key and HTTP — no RPC, no gas — can hire.
 *
 * The 402 half is the x402 envelope of relay.contract.ts (the terms are the
 * escrow primitive's, unchanged); this contract adds `task_id` so the agent
 * can correlate a quote with the task it will fund, and the 201 shape.
