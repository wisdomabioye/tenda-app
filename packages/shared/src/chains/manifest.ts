/**
 * Chain manifest — the SINGLE source of truth for every public, deployment-
 * independent fact about a supported chain. Imported by the server (registry,
 * seeder, sponsor, webhooks) and mobile (asset/chain metadata, the AppKit EVM
 * network list, and the wallet's per-namespace chain id). Adding a chain in an
 * already-supported namespace (any Solana cluster, any EVM L2) is ONE entry here
 * plus its per-deployment secrets — no other code changes, on the server OR in
 * the mobile app. (A brand-new native gas token still needs its one ASSET_META
 * row — display data, keyed by asset id.) Every EVM entry MUST carry both
 * `publicRpcUrl` and `explorerUrl`, the public facts the mobile network needs.
 *
 * Split of responsibilities (everything that is NOT here):
 *   - SECRETS / endpoints (RPC URL, deployed contract/treasury addresses,
 *     webhook secrets) are per-deployment → flat env vars, loaded by the
 *     server's `chains/secrets.ts`. The manifest carries none of them.
 *   - Asset DISPLAY metadata (symbol/decimals/is_stable) stays in ASSET_META,
 *     keyed by asset id; the manifest references asset ids and never restates it.
 *
 * Three orthogonal fields, each with one job (do not conflate):
 *   - `namespace` → which adapter runs it AND which secret schema it reads.
 *   - `gasPolicy` → how gas is covered (drives the registry's dep wiring).
 *   - `family`    → network group; a deployment runs at most ONE chain per
 *                   family (Base mainnet XOR Base Sepolia), enforced by the
 *                   secret loader. This also prevents the global `assets.id`
 *                   PK (e.g. `USDC_BASE`) colliding across two active networks.

 *
 * - 'live'      a CONFIRMED deployment — a broadcast transaction with a

 *               `forge script` run is not a deployment: Celo mainnet has three
 *               such runs on disk, every one with a null tx hash and no
 *               receipt.
 * - 'launching' the deploy is committed and next, but not on-chain yet. Exactly
 *               one chain should normally hold this.
 * - 'planned'   intended, unscheduled. No date, no commitment.
 *
 * The split between the last two is not cosmetic. With one bucket the landing
 * said "mainnet launching on 0G, Solana, Base and Celo" — four imminent
 * launches announced when only 0G was being deployed, which is the original
 * over-claim rebuilt one level down. A launch is a schedule claim and only
 * belongs on the chain actually being shipped to.
 *
 * Do not re-derive any of this from `kind` or from list ORDER. The landing
 * already knows 0G leads (LANDING_FAMILY_ORDER, launch positioning); position
 * in a list is not the same claim as a committed deploy, and reading one off
 * the other is how the first version of this bug happened.
